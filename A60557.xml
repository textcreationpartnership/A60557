            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>im be aſhamed, and the Lord will go on with his Work, who is come to restore Man into the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive purity he was first created in: Man that hath been drove from him into the Earth, by reaſon of Tranſgreſſions, and been a Servant to ſin, and under the power of Satan, and been ignorant of the Life of God, and of the ſweet refreſhments of his living preſence, not knowing the
<pb facs="tcp:44321:3"/>motions and leadings of the Father, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath his ear been open to hear the voice of God, but hath been without any ſenſible feeling of the Life and Power of God, and had no ſavour of the things of God. In this condition is Man, that is drove from God in the Fall: But now is the Lord come to reſtore him again by his beloved Son Chriſt Jeſus, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deems Man again from his loſt eſtate, and brings him out of the Earth, and out of all ſuch things which had ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated him from God, to delight in the Lord his Maker again; and from being a Servant of ſin, to be a Servant of God, and of Righteouſneſs and Holineſs, and to bring him again into Innocency, in which he was first created. And this hath been the Work of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> the Lord from Heaven, in all that did receive him, and it is his Work at this day. The Father of Mercy and great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, he hath conſidered Mankind who had corrupted his way, and he ſent his Meſſengers to foretell the coming of the acceptable day of the Lord, and the day of Salvation of God, who invited all the
<pb facs="tcp:44321:3"/>hungry and thirſty to come and drink at the Fountain of Life. And this was the free Love of God, to help Man out of the Pit wherein there was no Water, and to offer him the Wells of Salvation to drink at, that ſo he might be waſhed from ſin and from pollution into which he was fallen, and could ſee no deliverer, till the Lord was pleaſed to open a door of Hope, and to ſet him free by his Son Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and to ſave that which was loſt, and to bring Peace and Salvation; whoſe power is indeed as able to cleanſe from ſin, as ever the Devils was to defile and corrupt. This is true, and witneſſed by ſome, though many cannot believe that ever any can be free from ſin in this life. Now he that is in the firſt birth, and ſees no further, but is overcome with ſin daily, and his mind is earthly and corrupt, and has never known the power of God to work in him the New birth, and a change from his ſinful Eſtate, he judges he can be no otherwiſe while he is here, and ſo is like a blind man, who though the Sun ſhines, becauſe he cannot ſee it, he will not believe that it ſhines, or that others ſee it.
<pb facs="tcp:44321:4"/>But this muſt not make the Faith of ſome void, who have known the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> to be a quickning Spirit, and have found him able to ſave to the utmoſt all that come unto God by him; and the bloud of Chriſt is to them of full effect, and they witneſs him to be a perfect Saviour: and indeed for this end was Chriſt given of the Father, and for this end came he into the World, and was made manifeſt, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the works of the Devil, and to ſave his People from their ſins; and until Christ hath brought Man out of the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion he hath fallen into, he hath not finiſhed the Work that the Father hath given him to do; for as ſin hath reigned unto death, ſo muſt Righteouſneſs reign unto Life Eternal; and as through the power of Lust man hath been defiled throughout in Body, Soul, and Spirit, ſo by the power of Chriſt is man to be ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied throughout in Body, Soul, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and being once cleanſed by his power, to be ſaved from thoſe ſins which formerly have defiled him: and by this Man doth witneſs the Restoration by Chriſt, and the renewing by the Holy
<pb facs="tcp:44321:4"/>Ghoſt into the Image of God again, which he had loſt whilſt in the Tranſgreſſion; and ſo Man comes again into unity with God, and to know his voice, his motions, and the leadings of his Holy Spirit, which while he was in darkneſs, and ſerved ſin, he was wholly ignorant of.</p>
            <p>This makes Man fruitful again unto God, who before was as a barren Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and whereas he was before filled with Darkneſs, he now comes to be filled with Light and Life, and now he hath Viſions and Revelations of Heavenly things: before he was crying, There was no Revelation nor Viſion, they are ceaſed; whilſt night was upon him he ſaw no Viſion, and becauſe he ſaw no Viſion, nor had no anſwer from God, therefore he thought it was ſo with all others, and that Revelation and Viſion was ceaſed; and he meaſured all men by his dark rule, darkneſs being over him, and his eye blinded.</p>
            <p>Whilſt he was in the firſt birth he was Earthly, his mind Earthly, delighting in Earthly things; he could not then believe there was any immediate Teachings of
<pb facs="tcp:44321:5"/>the Father by his Holy Spirit, nor any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of Heavenly things; neither was his eye inward, but to an outward Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, and outward Books and Writings; but when the inward ear came to be opened, and the day of the Lord appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto him, then he heard the words of God, and ſaw the Viſions of the Almighty, and then he began to praiſe the Lord for his goodneſs, and for his mercies which endure for ever.</p>
            <p>And now being come to taſte of the loving kindneſs of the Lord, and his heart being filled with Heavenly bleſſings, he miniſters forth the ſame to others; and theſe are the true Miniſters indeed, who are moved by this bleſſed power of God to ſeek the Salvation of Souls: And of this number was our dear Brother <hi>Stephen Smith,</hi> (now deceaſed) a man who laboured in faithfulneſs and conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, according to the ability God had given him, to beget others to the Truth; and was constant in Sufferings, in Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels and Labours, and had a good eſteem in the hearts of many for his faithfulneſs to the Lord, as you well know, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

<pb facs="tcp:44321:6"/>Learning, natural acquirements and parts, but more eſpecially many of the plain, ſimple and unlearned, to the end that not only his Power might the more appear, and ſhine in its glory over all fleſh and the glory of man, but alſo that God in his wiſdom is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly pleaſed to condeſcend to the loweſt and meaneſt capacities, in moſt familiar ways, to direct his ſpeech and Teſtimony of Life for the reaching peoples ſeveral capacities and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, ſo as to turn them to that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Light and Truth, which through Chriſt Jeſus he has placed in them: God hath in our day, as in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages, raiſed up Plowmen, Herdſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Fiſhermen, Husbandmen, and ſuch like, to be experimental and more effectual Preachers to men of ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities, then Academical or School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men with all their Learning, acquired parts, and School craft; and with a plain Teſtimony in the ſimplicity of the Goſpel, condeſcended to accommodate and anſwer low and mean capacities, with that truth and ſimplicity that is in
<pb facs="tcp:44321:7"/>Chriſt Jeſus, which has been to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding of the wiſdom of the wiſe; ſo that it may be truly ſaid, where is the wiſe? where is the Scribe? where is the diſputer of this World? hath not God made fooliſh the wiſdom of this World? and not many wiſe men after the fleſh, not many mighty, not many noble are called, but God hath choſen the fooliſh things of the World to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the wiſe. And although the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Writings and Diſcourſes of this our dear and honeſt-hearted Friend <hi>Stephen Smith,</hi> now deceaſed and at reſt with the Lord, do not beſpeak him a man educated in artificial Learning, Oratory and Eloquence, yet he was a ſimple, plain-hearted and ſincere man, to what the Lord made manifeſt in him, and one that eyed the power and preſence of God in his Life and Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, ſince the God of all our mercies was graciouſly pleaſed to open his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, with the knowledge of his Divine Light and Truth, as it is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord; he prized it as his great mercy from the moſt gracious
<pb facs="tcp:44321:7"/>God, that after his long and weariſom travels in many Countries, and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes in the troubleſom and toſſing Sea of the World, he at length arrived at his deſired Haven of ſafety, being brought to know a true ſtay to his mind, and a quiet habitation of repoſe in the Sanctuary and holy Tabernacle of him who dwells in the Light, and hath Immortality dwelling in the Light. I knew this man from the firſt time of his being convinced and receiving Gods holy Truth, (which was in the year 1665.) who in mercy to him made me inſtrumental therein; and when his underſtanding and heart was opened, through the plain evidence and Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Spirit of Life, concurring with the witneſs, manifeſtation and operation thereof in his own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, (as it always doth) he received the Truth in the Love of it, and gave up to obey and walk in the ſame, and truly loved Gods faithful Meſſengers and People, how deſpiſed and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſoever they were, and freely gave up to partake with them of their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings,
<pb facs="tcp:44321:8"/>and did likewiſe ſuffer with them both in Perſon and Eſtate, by Impriſonments and ſpoil of Goods, for his tender Conſcience and Teſtimony on the behalf of Chriſt Jeſus; who as he gave him a Teſtimony to bear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Hireling oppreſſing Teachers and Prieſts, who preach for hire, and impoſe that great oppreſſion and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian yoke of Tithes, (according as he ſignifies in ſome of his Writings) ſo he gave up to ſuffer and endure Spoil, rather then in the leaſt he could pay them, or gratifie the covetous mind or greedy appetite of ſuch Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds as feed themſelves, and not the Flock, and make a prey upon people, and with force and cruelty rule over them. And laſtly, as he was a man fearing God, and of good report in his Country, being an exemplary Preacher of Righteouſneſs in his Converſation, and one truly kind and ready to do good in his day; ſo God was pleaſed in ſome meaſure to endue him with a living Miniſtry, and experimental and innocent Teſtimony to tell of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb facs="tcp:44321:8"/>and ſpeak forth his praiſe to others, from an inward ſence thereof in himſelf, and to the comfort and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of many that heard him. I ſpeak what I know herein, he having at ſundry times travelled with me in the work and ſervice of God in the Goſpel of his Son Chriſt Jeſus; and we travelled together more particularly at one time to viſit Friends in <hi>Surrey, Suſſex,</hi> and <hi>Kent,</hi> in which Journey we were much and often comforted toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Lords work, and in the Aſſemblies of Friends, which was near upon a year before his deceaſe. Well I am ſatisfied in my very Soul, that as he is taken away from the Evil to come, ſo he is entred into his Reſt, and has his portion with the Bleſſed that dye in the Lord. From a Living Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of this my dear Friend <hi>Stephen Smith,</hi> and a real ſence of his Innocent Life, Spirit and Converſation, and in honour and due reſpect to that Divine power and work of God in him, I was really concerned in my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to give this precedent Teſtimony;
<pb facs="tcp:44321:9"/>truly deſiring and praying to God, that all Friends profeſſing the ſame Truth, may concur in the ſame Spirit and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Faithfulneſs to the end; even ſo as to obtain the ſame bleſſed end of the Righteous, that will crown all our Labours, Travels and Sufferings which in this World we partake of, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure for the Teſtimony of Jeſus and of a good Conſcience.</p>

               <hi>The Teſtimony that lives in my heart concerning the Life and Death of that holy and worthy Servant of the Lord,</hi> Stephen Smith.</head>
            <p>O The remembrance of that holy and worthy Servant of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whoſe Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly power he was made a holy Temple for the Lord to walk in, whoſe Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Veſſel was filled with Gods Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Treaſure, by which the Life of Jeſus was made manifeſt in his mortal Fleſh, ſo that the excellency was of God, and not of man; ſo that by Gods holy power he was made a perfect and upright man, one that feared God, and hated all manner of Evil whereſoever it did appear: And indeed I can never forget him, whoſe blameleſs and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Life, and holy Converſation, when he was amongſt us, it was a good pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern unto us; for he was a man of a meek and gentle, and of a tender Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in which he was very careful and tender to all in whom the leaſt appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Truth did manifeſt it ſelf, for which his Travels and his Labours
<pb facs="tcp:44321:10"/>were very great for the Truth and Chriſts ſake, in whom he was made very inſtrumental, as in the hand of the Lord, that he thereby might beget a People unto the Lord; being not ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to eat his Bread alone, as many yet living can truly teſtifie to the truth hereof; knowing that he was a true and faithful Labourer in the glorious Goſpel of our Lord and Saviour Chriſt Jeſus, for whoſe ſake he was made willing to ſuffer, for he accounted it all joy that he was counted of the Lord worthy to ſuffer for his Name ſake; who truly trampled upon <hi>Aegypts</hi> Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and choſe rather to ſuffer afflictions with the People of God, then to enjoy the pleaſures of Sin for a ſeaſon; who often ſaid, he accounted nothing the Lord had bleſſed him withall, too dear to part withall for Chriſts and his Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels ſake; concluding that it was but a reaſonable Sacrifice to part with Life, and all that a man hath, for Chriſts ſake; and he that could not part with all for Chriſts ſake, was not worthy of him. And he was a man of a tender and of a broken Spirit, and always conſtant in his Love to all his Brethren
<pb facs="tcp:44321:11"/>in the Truth, and having a great eſteem of them therein; and whoſe care was very great over all the Flock of God, who was filled with the Spirit of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and underſtanding, in which he truly laboured to prevent all manner of differences or diſcord that might happen among Brethren; and if any did happen, he was always willing to compoſe and reconcile all manner of differences, which would have been to the great diſhonour of the Lord and his Truth, which was prevented by him, ſo that he was a true Peace-maker; and he was as a Father to the Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and as a Husband to the Widow; and as a Child, I have been often a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of his Fatherly kindneſs, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſtill in the remembrance of the ſame, I hope I ſhall never forget but to return the honour and glory to God, who is the Fountain of all our bleſſings and mercies, from whence floweth all our freſh Springs, in and through Chriſt Jeſus the Son of Gods Love, in whom was the Spring of Life flowing in and through him, even to the great ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of my Soul, as one that did but partake of the overflowings of that
<pb facs="tcp:44321:11"/>Life, in which his Soul was deeply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolated and wrapt up in the Heavenly Joy of the Lord God: ſo that in the greateſt extremity of his weakneſs, he would be very often declaring of the great and mighty loving kindneſs of the Lord God, by which he was lifted up above the fear of death: Nor was he afraid of the terrors thereof, ſo that a little before his departure, I being preſent with him, he being filled with Gods heavenly Spirit, by which he was enabled to pray and ſupplicate the Lord God of his Life, in which he was praiſing and magnifying that holy and innocent Life of Jeſus, ſaying, <hi>Lord and deareſt God, O aſſiſt in this Heavenly paſſage from death to life;</hi> who being ſubject to the will of his Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſaid further to me, <hi>Now I am go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into my ſweet ſleep;</hi> ſo that he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately and innocently laid down his head in perfect peace with the Lord, and lives for evermore.</p>
            <p>O the heavenly and the bleſſed Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the Lord God, that ſprung in and through him, by a heavenly Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to them that came to viſit him, ſaying, <hi>That it was a bleſsed and a
<pb facs="tcp:44321:12"/>heavenly thing to have the mind clear and holy, free from all troubles and cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of this evil World,</hi> as he truly ſaid <hi>his was; having all given up to the will of the Lord, that it might truly be done in Earth as it is in Heaven. O what a bleſſed and a heavenly Habitation is this for the Soul of man to rest in, which I have a full aſsurance of!</hi> And a little after there came in one to ſee him, and he exhorted him, <hi>to dread and fear the Lord God, and to repent of all his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, whatſoever that holy and pure wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in his conſcience makes manifeſt to be evil:</hi> So if happily he may find mercy with the Lord, which will be better to thee, ſaid he, then all the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides. And a little after came in another to ſee him; ſo that the mighty power of the Lord God was ſeen and felt, whereby he was refreſhed again, and deſired her <hi>to fear the Lord, that thereby ſhe might be preſerved out of all evil;</hi> and deſired her <hi>to love the Truth above all, for the Truth is a very precious thing; and to be ſure to keep low and humble to it, and not to be high-minded, nor exalted above the pure of God in her conſcience, for that would he very hurtful to her.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:44321:12"/>
            <p>About two or three days after, the bleſſed heavenly power of the Lord did ariſe in him, from which did ſpring a living and a heavenly Teſtimony in a holy remembrance of the tender deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Lord with him, from his Childhood to this very day; who ſaid to his Sons, <hi>That his days were very near drawing to an end;</hi> and declared, <hi>how that his Father and Mother caſt him off when he was but a little Lad:</hi> But the Lord had always preſerved him, and his Bleſſings did always attend him, in raiſing him up by multiplying his Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings upon him, having been often in many great dangers and perils by Sea and Land: <hi>So,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>having my mind chaſt and ſober to God, and having the fear of the Lord placed in my heart, by which I was preſerved out of evil, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the thing that was right in the ſight of the Lord; ſo that I found favour of the Lord, and gained the love and ſavour of all people, in dealing juſtly and truly with all people, not wronging any man.</hi> So this in charge he gave to his Sons, <hi>That they might always be kept chaſt and fober in their minds, having always their minds to the fear of the Lord placed in their
<pb facs="tcp:44321:13"/>hearts, that thereby they might be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved out of evil, and doing always that that is just and right; and to be ſure to be courteous and kind to all, loving the good in all, and bearing their Teſtimony againſt the evil in all whereſoever it doth appear. And whenſoever</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>you go about that which is weighty, take coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of good and ſound Friends, ſo that all things may be done to the honour and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Lord and his bleſſed Truth in which your bleſſings are all yea and</hi> Amen. And adviſed them, <hi>not to run into the Cumbers of the World, but to wait upon the Lord, and he will find out a way for them in his time: For the Lord</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>is a calling and taking me out and from all Troubles and Cumbers, from the evil that is a coming upon this wicked World, in a good time wherein I am aſſured of that ſound and perfect peaee, wherein my Soul reſteth with the Lord for evermore; ſo that I have no more to do now, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire the Lord to make my paſſage eaſie to his Heavenly Reſt.</hi>

               <p>And thoſe that come amongſt the Poſſeſſors of the Truth, who have heard the ſound of it, and ſo a belief is raiſed in their hearts, that God is found by them that diligently ſeek him in the Way of Truth; many there be that are thus perſwaded, and ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Meetings (together with them that are in the work of Truth) in a bare Profeſſion of Truth, never through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given up to the end that Truth may be their <hi>Guide</hi> in all their wayes, but come and ſits down with ſome reſerve in their Hearts, which they covet to keep, as <hi>Achan</hi> did the goodly Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniſh Garment, which was appointed for the Fire; but for ſo doing the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:44321:18"/>Curſe of the Lord followed him, though his covetouſneſs was a trouble to the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for a time, yet at length God made it manifeſt; and ſo will the Lord do thoſe who comes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt <hi>Friends</hi> with a reſerve in their hearts; that which is appointed for the Fire, they that covet to keep, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the many Precious Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings they come to, and hear their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions plainly laid open to them, yet ſtill conſulting with Fleſh and Blood, which will never yield that true obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience ſhould be given to the Lord, ſo cannot amend, but continue in the ſame courſe of Life, for not taking heed to the Councel of the Lord, nor giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholly up to be guided by the Spirit of Truth; ſuch are not in the the Way of Truth, but ſit down as Branches by thoſe of the Vine; but their Fruit doth manifeſt them: for thoſe that deals ſo deceitfully with their own Hearts, how can it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected they ſhould be true to others? ſo ſuch becomes an ill ſavour to Truth, as long as they continue ſo, and a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:44321:18"/>and a trouble to them that are in the way of growing in the Truth; but let them know who harden their hearts againſt Reproof, and though they do come amongſt them that live in the Fear and Dread of the Lord, and ſo meet together that they may receive a continual ſupply of the Bread of Life, and enjoy the preſence of the Lord; yet their ſo coming with a reſerve in their heart, they cannot profit by it: So at length, ſeeing they cannot bring the Way of the Lord to their way, they begin to grow cold in meeting, and ſo by degrees the Enemy draws out the mind, and then gets room for his conſultations, and ſo perſwades them to wait no longer, but that all Places are alike: and ſo at length ſome get into the Maſs-Houſe, with other ſilly People <hi>laden with ſins, ever learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and never able to come to the Truth;</hi> and begin to perſwade themſelves, (or the Enemy of their Souls per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades them) that there is a little dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the Declaration of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Chriſt and Antichriſt; their
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:44321:19"/>words, ſay they, are all good, and ſo begin to build <hi>Babel</hi> again, having rejected that Love which did appear for their Everlaſting good, having choſen to pleaſe themſelves in ſome ſmall thing, which they could not part with, though no better then a Meſs of Pottage, for which many have ſold an Eternal Inheritance; ſo with <hi>Cain</hi> they are in the Curſe, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering up and down in that which is curſed of the Lord, and not beloved of good men; ſo the Lord hath dealt juſtly in making them manifeſt, <hi>They went out from us, becauſe they were not of us,</hi> but their reward will follow them. And many others there be that come to Meetings, and hear Truth declared often, and confeſſeth its the Truth, but when they ſee, if they come to obey, they muſt take up a Croſs to Fleſh, either in denying to fear man, or elſe hazard of loſing Goods, and ſome their Companions and Acquaintance, (though it may be in iniquity) and ſuch like Baits the Enemy of mans Soul hath ready, for
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44321:19"/>that mind which is willing ro catch at them, to ſave that alive which is in the Curſe; ſo ſometimes they come, and ſometimes they ſtay away, and then come again, and the Enemy of their Souls gets a wound now and then; but for want of giving up, at length the Enemy begins to be whole again, and ſo the Spirit of the Lord is grieved and quenched by degrees, and the Enemy grows ſtronger and ſtronger; and at length he gets theſe Reaſons in the Creature, becauſe the Enemy knows many will not be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied without ſome plauſible Reaſon; ſo he tells many, why thou art but a poor Creature, or you are but poor Creatures, and what can you do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out power? ſo here the willing mind readily catches at this bait: and then when they are asked, why they give not up, O ſay they, we want power, O that I had but power to do ſo and ſo, how joyful ſhould I be; and ſuch like ſtuff the Enemy furniſheth them withall, who are willing to receive it, and in the mean time ſlight the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:44321:20"/>of Chriſt, (the Light, in whom Power is received) by grieving and quenching his Holy Spirit of Truth, in which is the greateſt manifeſtation of Love that God could beſtow on loſt Mankind, in making manifeſt his Son in their hearts, for the redeeming them up unto himſelf, out of their loſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, in the nature of <hi>Adam</hi> in the fall, up into the Nature of the Second <hi>Adam,</hi> which never fell: but how is this Love of God ſlighted by thoſe who thus wilfully yield to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of their Souls, and rejecting the Lord, who ſearcheth the Heart and tryeth the Reins, and then ſay they want power; and its true, when peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have given themſelves up to the power of the Enemy, whoſe nature is to do all the hurt he can, they may well ſay then they want power to do good, that being diſeſteemed and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of as a thing of nought, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing caſt behind them the great Love of God in his Son, and embraced ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which the Enemy hath ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, as ſome glory in the World,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:44321:20"/>and the like; but as he was alwayes a Lyar, (the Devil) ſo will he be found in this; for inſtead of giving them the glory of the World, he is fitting them for Gods Wrath and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, that ſo when he is caſt out of thoſe more upright hearts, and more thankful, that he may poſſeſs thoſe Swiniſh natures, and ſo throw them headlong into a Sea of Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whith others of the like bad na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, of whom I ſhall ſay ſomething.</p>
               <p>Thoſe are they which have heard and ſeen ſomething of Truth, by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Books, or ſpeaking with ſome in the Truth, whoſe words being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with power, proceeding from the Spirit of Truth, they not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been able to reſiſt, but ſtanding over them, queſtionings and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing have been raiſed in them concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning their buildings, whether or no they be upon the right Foundation; but that being catch'd too, which ſhews them their conditions ſo plain, that they have no aſſurance of their well-being, but in doubting, and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:44321:21"/>and fears, through which ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly torment doth ariſe; but their minds being from him that ſhews them their conditions, which, though it be the greateſt Love that God could beſtow on loſt Mankind. yet in that it brings a Croſs to fleſh, ſeeing plainly that if they hearken to it, they muſt forſake all their vain Cuſtoms and Traditions of the World, with all its Luſts and Vanities; theſe things not agreeing with Fleſh and Blood, which they are conſulting, the mind being drawn from the Witneſs for God in their hearts, by their wilful yielding to the Enemy of their Souls, who is alwayes ready with his Baits to betray them who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire eaſe in the Fleſh, and whoſe minds are out in ſtudying Arguments to keep them in the ſame, the ſubtle Serpent being here at work, to the end that the Creature may partake of his Table, for he knows that then they cannot partake of Gods Table, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Truth declares; ſo at his Table he hands out curious words, in Prayers, and hanging down the head
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:44321:21"/>like a Bullruſh, and with feigning and flattering words to all ſorts of Deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Workers, and doth help to turn and wind all ſorts of Worſhip, which the Beaſtly Nature ſets up, and ſo tells them there is Fleſh as well as Spirit to be ſatisfied, and that they muſt live in ſin, as long as they have a being here; and to others, whoſe natures be inclined to Luſt, he provides plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Diſhes for them; and others, who are diſpoſed to Drunkenneſs, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects them to Companions, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity; and at his Table are va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Diſhes for the Covetous man, or Proud, High, Heady, Boaſter, Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, Ranter, for all ſorts that will come to his Table, he hath curious Diſhes in a plenteous manner, and in all theſe he promiſes content and ſatisfaction; but as he ever was, ſo he is, and ever will be a Lyar; for let thoſe ſpeak who hath fed moſt plentiful at his Table, if ever they were ſatisfied, but that the more they fed the more hungry they were; let all theſe foremention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Gamſters ſpeak for themſelves,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44321:22"/>and Thieves, and Murtherers, and the like. But in ſome he works more in a Myſtery, and furniſheth his Table with curious words, and ſo feeds them, and decks them; but alwayes at his Table he hath this Diſh for all ſorts of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors and Prophane, that they muſt live in Sin, in this Life; this is, as it were a Chain, by which he holds all (that will believe ſo,) faſt to his Table; and then let them be as rich as they will, in comprehending, and getting into the Brain-knowledge the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and outward Learning, ſo though the work grows ſo high in the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Iniquity, that the Enemy of the Soul hath exalted himſelf above all that is called God, and ſo makes a ſhew in fine words, and in long Prayers, and in curious Arts; yet whilſt he can keep them in his Chain to his Table, if they cannot have eaſe in profeſſing in one Sect, he will give them leave to profeſs in another Sect; and if that will not ſerve he will give them leave to go into the profeſſion of Truth it ſelf; and further, to meet together with
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:44321:22"/>them in the Truth, any thing but hearing the Voice of the Son of God, and obeying, which brings to the Table of God, and ſo overthrows his Table; to any thing but this his Chain will reach: Now, as to what is before, thoſe that have ſeen ſomething of Truth, and ſome trouble hath by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thereof riſen in them, but for love of a little eaſe to the fleſh, ſuch their minds being out, willingly goes into the Devils Chain, and ſo feeds at his Table, where they are furniſhed with Arguments againſt the Spirit of Truth manifeſted to lead and to guide into all truth, and ſo out of Sin, which is the Devils Chain; but being thus fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed according to their hearts luſt, being in the Adulterous Spirit, takes all occaſion to ſpeak evil of Truth, and them that are in it, who are true Worſhippers of the Lord, according to his Will, in Spirit and Truth; ſo the god of the World having blinded their minds, an evil eye gets out, and this watches for the halting of them who are in Truth; and when the juſt hand
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:44321:23"/>of God is gone out, in making mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt ſome who have been in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Truth, who have hardned their hearts againſt reproof, till at length their hypocriſie and guile is made manifeſt; on which, they here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by take occaſion to ſpeak evil of the Way of the Lord, and them that are in it, the Enemy of their Souls giving them thereby ſome eaſe for the preſent; but it laſts not long, but the Fame of Truth is ſounded in their ears again, by the Witneſs of God within, or elſe from thoſe in whom it dwells without them; then the Lamb riſeth, and gives torment again, and their Coverings be too narrow, and will not ſerve them, neither ſhall they; <hi>Wo to the Rebellious Children, ſaith the Lord, that take Counſel, but not of me, and that cover with a covering, but not with my Spirit:</hi> So all unrighteous Coverings which people of unſtable minds are under, the Wo of the Lord is againſt, ſo what will become of them that are under them? O that men would in coolneſs conſider, whoſe day of Gods Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:44321:23"/>in Love is not paſt, leaſt by their often provocations, he viſits in his great diſpleaſure, and ſays, <hi>My Spirit is weary with ſtriving, it ſhall ſtrive no more:</hi> now for the ſakes of many who have yet true Breathings after Living Refreſhment, and are willing to take up Chriſts Yoke and Burthen, and to follow him that is meek and lowly in heart, that ſo they may reſt for their Souls; for their ſakes I ſhall give a brief Relation of the Miniſters of Chriſt, and of the Miniſters of Antichriſt: Firſt, The Miniſters of Chriſt muſt know Chriſt, and ſee him, and believe on him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.40. But ſome will ſay, Who is there that knows not Chriſt? Doth not all that can read ſee what is writ of him in the Scriptures of Truth? And is not the Chriſt which you mean, who ſuffered without the Gates of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the like? Yes, we do own the ſame Chriſt, and that which the Scriptures do declare of him is true, and we do expect no other; but to know him no further then the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of him, (though that be true)
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:44321:24"/>this is but a poor knowledge, which the Workers of Iniquity have, of all ſorts, that lives viſibly in groſs and manifeſt Sins; and notwithſtanding that knowledge, yet live and abound in the ſame; ſo that knowledge only (though that, as I have ſaid, be true) is not ſufficient to fit a man to be a Miniſter of Chriſt: But ſaith the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Enquirer, What knowledge then is neceſſary for a Miniſter of Chriſt? To know him as he is the Myſtery hid from Ages and Generations, but now is made manifeſt to his Saints: to know what is the Riches of the Glory of this Myſtery among the Gentiles, <hi>which is Chriſt in you the Hope of Glory,</hi> Colloſ. 1.26, 27. To know him as he is a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant given to the People, and a Light to enlighten them, manifeſted within them, to give the knowledge of God; and to know that he is the Light of the World, and how he hath enlightned every man that comes into the World: to know him to be the Word in the Heart and Mouth: to know him to be the Reconciler unto
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:44321:24"/>God: to know him to be the Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is true, and teacheth all things: to know him to be the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Truth, which is manifeſt to lead and to guide into all Truth: to know Chriſts Fleſh, and what it is to eat it: to know Chriſts Blood, and what it is to drink it: but ſome will ſay all this may be read in the Scriptures: But by the way, though the words may be read in the Scriptures of Truth, yet the knowledge of the Myſtery which is declared of in thoſe words, is not attainable by reading them: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome are willingly ignorant, and ſo deſires to be, rather then to have true wiſdom in Gods way, and ſo ſtumbles at all; I ſhall ſay a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſeeing the Son, which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for a Miniſter of Chriſt: Firſt, To ſee him to be the great Love of God manifeſted to convince of Sin: to ſee him to be the wonderful Power of God, and how that he died, to the end, that whether we ſleep or wake we ſhould live together with him: to ſee him as he was manifeſt to deſtroy
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:44321:25"/>the Works of the Devil. to ſee him to be the great Myſtery of Godlineſs, God manifeſt in the Fleſh; and much more might be ſaid of the knowledge and ſight which a true Miniſter of Chriſt hath, but what hath been ſaid is enough to ſatisfie the truly hungring and thirſting Soul; but the full loath the Hony-Comb: But is this all the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right-hearted ſay? Nay, they that thus have obtained mercy to have the knowledge of what is above declared, muſt receive it in the love of it, and this Love of God thus manifeſted in them they muſt give up to obey, being his Everlaſting and Unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Covenant, which is the Key of knowledge, manifeſted to rend the Vail, and to break the Chain of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to open the Myſteries of the Scriptures of Truth, and to give the knowledge of God, whom to know is Eternal Life; ſo Iniquity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken away, and Sin being purged through the knowledge of Chriſt, who is the Power of God, and God known to walk, and to dwell in them
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:44321:25"/>through the Son of his Love, who is Gods Righteouſneſs, as God hath ſaid, <hi>I will dwell in you, and walk in you:</hi> The Eye of the Underſtanding being thus opened, and the Revelation of Chriſt being dayly witneſſed to ſit and to furniſh them with Wiſdom from above, to ſpeak a word in ſeaſon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all conditions; being thus filled with the Love of God, and his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Appearance, a conſtraint lying upon them, through the Power of God that dwells in them, and from the great Love of God in the ſame, ſuch cannot be ſilent, nor eat their Morſel alone; but the Love of God doth conſtrain them who have Wives, and Children, and Eſtates, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral others that have no Wives and Children, to leave their Callings, and ſeveral Imployments, and go abroad as Sheep among Wolves, to declare this great and unſpeakable Love, to the end, <hi>That People may be turned from Darkneſs to Light, and from Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans power, to the Power of God,</hi> that others may partake of the ſame Love
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:44321:26"/>of God in his Son Chriſt Jeſus with them: But for this their love, how Barbarouſly and Cruelly they have been uſed, many having finiſhed their Teſtimony in Naſty Holes, and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and other great Cruelties, which would be too long to relate; ſo theſe thus furniſhed with the Love and Power of God, and being obedient to the ſame, being Learned men in the Book of Life; theſe are not to take with them Scrip nor Purſe, ſo as to be careful of Earthly things, (but as they have received freely, do Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter freely) but into what houſe they come, where this great Love is anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in the ſame Love of God in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, what things ſuch ſet before them, for neceſſity they eat and drink, and the like, ſeeing it comes from their Fathers Love: but when they come into a place and cannot ſee, in the Counſel of the Lord, that that Love is anſwered in which they come, there they cannot receive, though in never ſo much neceſſity. True, ſay ſome, theſe are fit Qualifications for a Miniſter of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:44321:26"/>Jeſus Chriſt; but be there any ſuch now adays? How doſt thou know them? Yes, I do teſtifie, as thouſands beſide my ſelf are ready to give the ſame teſtimony, that ſuch Miniſters, qualified, as before-mentioned, there be many in this Day of Gods Power: But how do you know, may ſome ſay? I anſwer, By turning us to the great and unſpeakable Love of God mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in our hearts, which ſhews us our conditions, how it ſtood between us and our Creator, as it had done long before, but we knew not that that was the appearance of the Son of Love, till thoſe who had taſted, handled, ſeen and felt the powerful working thereof told us; but told us alſo, the firſt ſtep muſt be through Judgment; ſo a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief thereof being raiſed, and a clean and a perfect obedience yielded to it, we in time found its power in us, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Eye of our Underſtandings, and revealed the man of Sin; and ſo came the knowledge of the Spirit of Truth to be revealed in us, and by it we had a ſight of the unfruitful
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:44321:27"/>Works of Darkneſs without in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, and the ſight of the Spirit of Truth, and thoſe that were Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of it: But notwithſtanding this Teſtimony, if ſome ſhould be hard to believe, let ſuch deal ſo ingeniouſly with their own Souls, as to go and hear, and try, with a ſingle heart, and hold faſt that which is good; and this is deſired, to the end that others may be partakers of the ſame Love of God, and of their aſſurance of their being reconciled unto him through his Son, to whom be glory for ever. Now there being a neceſſity that the Miniſters of Chriſt ſhould be qualified, as is before mentioned, the Miniſters of Antichriſt may be eaſily known; but for the ſakes of ſuch afore-mentioned, I ſhall lay down ſome marks of them: Firſt, They are ſuch who never knew the Son of God in the Everlaſting and Unchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Covenant manifeſted in them, ſo not learned men in the Book of Life, but are alienated from the Life of God, through the ignorance that is in them, knowing him manifeſted in them, who
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:44321:27"/>is Infallible, but in their fallible wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, by the Art of Tongues, gets the Prophets, Chriſts, and the Apoſtles words, and ſomething out of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Authors, and ſo in their vain ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations patches up anothers Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; and ſo for the love they have for their god which is their Belly, they ſell their Art at as dear a price as they can, for ſeveral hundreds by the year, ſome for more, and ſome for leſs, but all as dear as poſſible; as I heard a Prieſt ſay once, if it were not for Tythes who as would ſhould preach for him: but this being ſo well known to all, that its alone for their god, which is their Belly, that their Mouths is opened, there is little need to ſpeak of that, theſe being Sayers, but not Doers, ſo not accepted of God; theſe are they which run and are not ſent, which ſpeaks a divination of their own Brain, ſo not like to profit the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, you may read of them at large <hi>Ezekiel</hi> the thirteenth, read the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; from ſuch Prieſts and Prophets as theſe is Profaneneſs gone forth in all
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:44321:28"/>the Land, read <hi>Jeremiah</hi> the twenty third; ſo they are ſufficiently markt out in the Scriptures of Truth. But ſome ſay, we know all the Prieſts now adays are bad enough, and the ſmooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of them preach for filthy lucre ſake, but they ſpeak good words; ſo we may do as they ſay, and as they do: O fooliſh people, is it not becauſe you love ſuch eaſie Prophets, who ſpeak peace to you in your Sins, that you thus ſpeak? have you not heard what the Scriptures of Truth ſayes? <hi>Do men gather Grapes of thorns, or Figs of Thiſtles? By their Fruits you may know them:</hi> Should we not count him a very Fool that ſhould go look for Figs on Thiſtles, or ſweet water out of a bitter Fountain? What if they ſhould ſay the Lord lives, that is a true ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them which know it in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but its a Lye to them who ſay it, and know the contrary in them; but theſe Prieſts which Preach for Hire, cry peace to men whilſt they put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Mouths, to the end their god may be ſupplyed, which cauſes and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:44321:28"/>conſtrains their Mouths to be open; but in caſe you deny to put into their Mouths, then <hi>Demetrius</hi> like, prepares War; crying out, we have a Law, and if you won't pay, we will make you pay: But by the way, what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive Law of men doth Chriſts Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters uſe, or were they to uſe? prove any ſuch thing in the Scriptures of Truth, that they were to compel any man to give to them: Now, if God hath appointed no ſuch Maintenance by his Righteous Covenant and Law; Is it not ſtealth in his ſight, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel and take that by mans Law, which God hath not appointed in his Law? Look about you Prieſts, for the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Judge will ſit in Judgment, and to the Lambs Bar to give an account you muſt come, and then the twiſting Serpent will ſtand you in no ſtead, but all things will be laid bare before you, what eſteem you have of your god, which is your Belly, for the ſerving of which, how have you yielded unto the lying Spirit, and ſo like <hi>Ahabs</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets perſwaded and inſtigated many
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:44321:29"/>to go on in the Perſecution, though to their deſtruction. Have you not told the Magiſtrates that the Quakers are Ring-Leaders of Faction, though you never come to their Meetings, nor never examined the cauſe why they diſſented from you; nor never heard that they went about to diſturb or moleſt any of their outward enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but barely becauſe they bore a faithful Teſtimony againſt the twiſting twining Serpent, the great Enemy of mans Soul; which Spirit of Error your god cannot be ſerved without: ſo a great ſtir and ado you make, in being Inſtruments of caſting into Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, haling and tearing away the Goods, and the like; from thoſe who lives in the Fear and Dread of the God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, and in peace with men though in enmity with the Serpent, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of mans Soul: ſo in the Innocent Blood which hath been ſhed in Naſty Holes, and Stinkiug Priſons, cries a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loud unto the Righteous Judge of Heaven and Earth, who is Lord of all, who created all at his pleaſure, and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:44321:29"/>can deſtroy all in the ſame; thoſe that be innocent, out of the revengeful ſpirit, have committed themſelves, and ſo cannot uſe any compulſive way, with Weapons that are Carnal, but in plain Demonſtration and Power of the Spirit of Truth, and their innocent Cauſe to the Judge of all they have committed, to be cleared in his will and time, who will aſſuredly do it. But further, to clear that you are the Miniſters of Antichriſt; if, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding what is declared, any yet be in doubt: Hearken what Chriſt ſaith to the Wicked, <hi>I was an hungry, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirſty, and ye gave me no drink: I was a ſtranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye cloathed me not: ſick, and in priſon, and viſited me not.</hi> Then ſhall they alſo anſwer him, ſaying, <hi>Lord, when ſaw we thee an hungred, or thirſty, or a ſtranger, or ſick, or in priſon, and did not miniſter unto thee?</hi> Then ſhall he anſwer them, ſaying, <hi>Verily, I ſay unto you, inaſmuch as ye did it not to one of the leaſt of theſe, ye did it not to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:44321:30"/>me; and theſe ſhall go away into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting puniſhment,</hi> Matth. 25. In the ſame Chapter he ſhews the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mans love, and his reward; and how did they expreſs their love to Chriſt? Did they do it in ſpeaking great words of his Name? No, as you may read, they viſited his Brethren in their neceſſities: ſo mark by the way, there were Righteous men, and now are, though the Miniſters of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt for the gods ſake, would have all erre and ſtray again from the Lords way; but the Pearl for which they have ſold all, and bought, is of more value then ſo; but ſince Chriſt hath Brethren, are not they them which are led by the Spirit of Truth? and if people be given up to obey it, will it not lead them out of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Error? If ſo, then muſt they not depart from your wayes, who are in the Revengeful Spirit? Well then, ſince thoſe that are led by the Spirit are Sons of God, as the Scriptures of Truth declare, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. and Heirs with Chriſt; for he that ſanctifieth
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:44321:30"/>and them that are ſanctified are all of one, wherefore he is not aſhamed to call them Brethren: now ſince there is ſuch an unity between Chriſt and his Followers, Shall it avail them any thing, who call upon Chriſt, yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute ſo near Relations, as his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren? And ſince thoſe that viſited them not in their neceſſities, received ſuch condemnation, what will become of you? And you, Generation of wicked Doers, who have been the cauſe of the Impriſoning ſo many of Chriſts Relations, where ſeveral hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds have laid down their lives for their faithful Teſtimony againſt you, becauſe of your Adultery from the Lord, and his Worſhip, which is to be performed in Spirit and Truth, and have ſet up worſhips according to your own hearts Luſt: and becauſe of the Lords Patience, and Long-ſuffering, and great Mercy, how do you har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den your hearts againſt Reproofs, and for good return evil, and ſo go on ſcoffing and mocking: well, though the Lord hath exerciſed a great deal
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:44321:31"/>of patience, it's my belief, it will not laſt long; but he will execute Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Judgment, and plead the cauſe of the Innocent, who hath committed all to him, with Praiſes and Glory from his own works for ever.</p>

            <head>A PROCLAMATION By way of EXHORTATION Unto all the Inhabitants of <hi>England;</hi> Concerning Faſting and Prayer: And that they may come to a certain Diſcerning and Knowledge of the Will of God therein, (who is King of the whole EARTH.</head>
            <head type="sub">[<hi>Firſt by way of Preparation unto a True</hi> FAST]</head>
            <p>COme all you who expect to be Heard and Accepted of the Living God; Faſting and Prayer, in the Spirit of Holineſs, is required
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:44321:32"/>as Neceſſary thereunto: but the want of a certain Knowledge Diſcerning, how, and in what manner the ſame ought to be Performed, (therefore it is that people are rejected) being all Vain Service and Loſt Labour, where no Reward is received, or when they ask amiſs, what anſwer ſhall ſuch have, judge ye? And therefore, be Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, I beſeech you, to mind that which gives you a Diſcerning and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Knowledge in this weighty Work: You may read what the Lord ſaid by his Servant <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> chap. 8. concerning Faſting; and what Chriſt Jeſus ſaid, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. but how long may people read theſe Sayings. (as well as others) and yet have no certain knowledge of the Will of God therein? I ſpeak of ſuch who are out of the way of a True Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; which all are who are in a bare Confeſſion, with their Mouths, that God ought to be feared; but the Heart, that not being right in his ſight, Infidelity that taking place there; from whence a Concluſion is drawn, <hi>That Sin, which is Evil, can't be parted with;</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:44321:32"/>this is a great Evil indeed, ſet up in the Heart by the ſpirit of Antichriſt; where a Form of Words, and large Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions concerning God and Chriſt are made; but the Bleſſed and Effectual Workings of God's Spirit in Fleſh, for the Deſtroying of Sin, that being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, the Enemy's works (which is Sin and Evil) they continue in the Heart (contrary to the Bleſſed Will of God) by which means the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Man's Underſtanding that is Clouded and Darken'd through Error and Falſhood; by which means the Minds of Mankind are exerciſed in a Brutiſh Underſtanding concerning Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Matters; imagining a Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Service to God by confeſſing, <hi>That he ought to be feared,</hi> (and yet live out of what they confeſs in a Talk) <hi>that all good Succeſs and Bleſſing comes from him,</hi> &amp;c. So then, let ſuch be judged by their own words, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs he ought to be feared, and yet live in Sin and Evil, under a ſtrange Deluſion, <hi>That thoſe Works can never be ſo destroyed, as to know Dominion and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:44321:33"/>Freedom from them on this ſide the laying down the Body, or at leaſt, till about that time of ſeparation from all outward vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible things:</hi> So here Sin, the Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of that hath been pleaded for by them who would be called <hi>Christians,</hi> and would be accounted ſuch who fear God, and that they are in his Service, though never expect to be free from ſin; What Service is that in Evil? And what Reward ſhall Evil Works have? Is not ſin an Evil work of the Evil One? And muſt not the Works of the Evil One, if continued in, have a Bad Reward?</p>
            <p>Oh that people would Fear God in Deed and in Truth! for they that fear him will do no Evil: So the way of a Right Underſtanding, that leads quite contrary to Sin and Evil: So its ſtrong Deluſion indeed, to expect a Right Underſtanding in an Evil Way; and Preſumption indeed it is, to hope for Good out of Evil.</p>
            <p>Oh, be Awakened to Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in which there's no ſin! and then will the Eye of the Underſtanding be
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:44321:33"/>opened to ſee the Man of ſin, who hath exalted himſelf above that of God in Man, under Confeſſions and Profeſſions of the Name of God and Chriſt, whilſt that ſignified by the Name, which is Power manifeſted in Fleſh, for the revealing the Man of ſin, and deſtroying his works, that hath been denyed by the Exaltation of the Man of ſin in man; by whom Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind hath been exalted above the Pure Principle of God in man, even above the Light of that Bleſſed and Unerring Spirit of Chriſt, by which that which is reproveable is made manifeſt: But through Unbelief of God's Love there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, Mankind in a great part being held under ſtrong Deluſions of Satan, their minds being exerciſed in a Brutiſh Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, ſome have called that Bleſſed Principle of God in man, <hi>a Deviliſh Light;</hi> and others <hi>a Bewilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Light,</hi> or <hi>a Natural Light;</hi> ſo that all that is of God in man that hath been denyed (whoſe Work do you think this is?) But if it were ſo, as the Wicked One in the wicked hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:44321:34"/>may it not be ſaid now, as it was in the dayes of old, after God had created Mankind upon the Earth, and they had corrupted their Wayes, which diſpleaſed God, who in his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure ſaid, <hi>My Spirit ſhall not alwayes ſtrive,</hi> &amp;c. Then was not Deſtruction nigh? but in that there was a time in which God's Holy Spirit did ſtrive with fleſh, it plainly appears, the good will of God was therein to have had it otherwiſe; but Mankind reſiſting his Way of bringing it to paſs, the Way of Salvation that was removed, and a Way of Deſtruction let in; ſo the Way of Salvation then that was by the mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and working of God's Good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the which had place in <hi>Noah,</hi> who was a perfect man in his day, who being moved in a True Fear of God had a Right Underſtanding, in which he was a Preacher according to the Will of God. So that Bleſſed Spirit of God, by which <hi>Noah</hi> had regard and was acted by, though it was rejected by Mankind in their corrupt Wayes, yet it was not <hi>Deviliſh</hi> nor <hi>Natural,</hi> as
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:44321:34"/>Mankind in their Brutiſh Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in great meaſure have concluded: but the leaſt meaſure of that pure Principle of God in Mankind of his Bleſſed Spirit, is Unerring; the which in meaſure, in all Ages, in God's Time and Seaſon did ſtrive in Mankind, and for the good of Mankind, that through it they might have been Preſerved out of Corrupt Wayes and Works, which Corrupt Wayes and Works was and is the Cauſe of all Heavy and Grievous Judgments in Ages paſt, and to come upon Mankind: So its plain and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, how Gracious, Merciful and Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering God hath been throughout all Ages through ſome meaſure of the ſhining of the Light of his Unerring Spirit, notwithſtanding the Great and Grievous Provocations of Mankind in their Corrupt Wayes, by which their Underſtandings were and are darkened, that they could not come to a clear Diſcerning what manner of Love of God that was unto them (as it is written) <hi>How often is the Candle of the Wicked put out,</hi> Job 21. So its
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:44321:35"/>plain, that was and is the Love of God in the Light of his Unerring Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, by which the Wicked were ſhewn their Wickedneſs in all Ages; and the putting that Love from them was, and is the Cauſe that the Wicked periſh in their Wickedneſs, through the Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Hearts, and Unbelief of the Love of God in his Bleſſed Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Light, which ſhines ſometimes even unto the Wicked, though they cry, <hi>Depart, I deſire not the Knowledge of thy Wayes:</hi> And though this Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Wicked, under many fair pretences of Confeſſions and Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of God, have labour'd to put away the way of the Lord, and through many Devices hath the Wicked One in his Agents in their Wickedneſs, ſet up many Corrupt Wayes; yet the Way of the Lord remains Pure forever, and can never be Corrupted, but it remains a True Witneſs againſt all Evil and Corrupt Wayes whatſoever. And this Perfect Way of God was the Way of the Upright in Heart in all Ages, by which they were led out of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:44321:35"/>Evil (though under more Servitude) before the fulneſs of time, when it pleaſed God ſo to cauſe his Light to ſhine forth in Fleſh, in an abſolute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Dominion over all the Luſts of the Fleſh, where Satan could get no En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance, though Forty Dayes Chriſt Jeſus was Tempted by him; ſo herein was the Son, who is the Heir of all, manifeſted. So all the true Prophets in all Ages, they had their Teſtimony from a meaſure of the Light of that Spirit; and there their Teſtimony end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (who were Faithful) and the Law written in Tables of Stone, that was by the Light of that Bleſſed Spirit, by which all might ſee and learn to come to Chriſt, in whom the Law is fulfilled: So here is the Prophet, whom <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpoke of, that God would raiſe up, whom all is to hear; and every Soul that will not hear that Prophet, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction attend it.</p>
            <p>So let none ſay in their Hearts, <hi>Who ſhall aſcend into Heaven,</hi> that is, <hi>to bring this Prophet Chriſt from above?</hi> or, <hi>Who ſhall deſcend into the deep,</hi> that is, <hi>to
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:44321:36"/>bring up Christ again from the Dead?</hi> For the Word is nigh, even in the Heart and Mouth; which Word of Faith the Miniſters which were True did Preach, and them which are True do Preach; and herein is the Labour of them whoſe Abiding is in the Word, that others may be turned to the Word in the Heart and Mouth, that by it they may be reconciled unto God: And this Bleſſed Word was in the beginning, before words were; <hi>All things being made by him, in whom is Life, and the Life was</hi> (and is) <hi>the Light of Men,</hi> who believe therein: And though the World did not, nor doth not know the Love of God here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, yet he was and is in the World; and though his Appearance was and is rejected by moſt, yet ſome did and do receive him, who felt and feel his Power to overcome the Luſts of the Fleſh, which is Sin and Evil; which Unſpeakable Love of God, ſhed abroad in the Hearts of the Primitive <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,</hi> by this Free Gift of his Holy Spirit, which made them who received
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:44321:36"/>the ſame, who were truly ſenſible of God's Love therein, undergo great and grievous things, ſome things of which may be read in the Scriptures of Truth. So their Faſting and Prayers being performed by the Movings and Guidings of that Bleſſed Principle of God, how were ſuch preſerved by the Power of God, in the Peace of God, wherein their Souls reſted in God? So the Bleſſed Name of the Lord was unto them a ſtrong Tower (which was the ſame to the Righteous in all Ages) but never was a more clearer Diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof then in this Age; there being a Cloud of Witneſſes of the Everlaſting Love of the Everlaſting God herein: and ſo they are Bleſſed who live up to that Bleſſed Principle of God in them, and continue Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the End in the Teſtimony there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: O the Remembrance of them will be had in great Eſteem in Ages and Generations to come.</p>
            <p>So now, that which is Chiefeſt of all, and of greateſt Value, let that be firſt minded, that all things may be
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:44321:37"/>done according to the Will of God; in order to which a Right Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is neceſſary, the which is better then <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver;</hi> for the Wicked may poſſeſs <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver,</hi> and things viſible to their Hurt, where a Right Underſtanding is wanting; for if Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Underſtanding be wanting, people periſh: Therefore be adviſed to wait in the Way of Underſtanding, the Fear of the Lord God, who made Heaven and Earth, the Sea, and all things elſe according to his good Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; here is the beginning of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and to attain to a Right Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: for, in the Fear of the Lord there's no Evil in that Way. So away with Invention and Imaginations of <hi>Fearing God,</hi> whilſt Concluſions are made, <hi>That Sin can't be parted with;</hi> all Wayes made up by men in Sin, are from a Corrupt Underſtanding: So come to the Fear of God, and he will teach us his Wayes; and all that come there come out of Evil; for there's no Evil in God's Wayes: ſo that they that are in God's Way, are out of Evil;
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:44321:37"/>by which it plainly appears, that all Wayes where Concluſions are made, <hi>That Sin, is in them;</hi> or, <hi>that they can't live out of Sin;</hi> or, <hi>that they know not a Way out of Sin;</hi> all ſuch, where ſuch Concluſions are made, are out of a Right Underſtanding, and their Wayes are Deſtructive, and their Works in them Wayes are Deſtructive, ſo that all who endeavour to ſave their Lives there, do want a Right Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; for Tranſgreſſion, which is Sin, is the Cauſe of Death; ſo all that are raiſed from Death, are raiſed from Sin, the Cauſe of it: ſo then, all that keep their Lives there, ſhall loſe Life; and all that loſe their lives there, ſhall find Life: So Bleſſed are they who ſerve the Living God, they do as they ſhould do; ſo that's no Evil (but Good) ſo let none think in their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Wayes, that they ſhall be fed with Knowledge and Underſtanding there (No, no) they will Starve and Periſh there for want of Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: ſo let all deal clearly with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in coolneſs and ſtillneſs, in the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:44321:38"/>ſilence of fleſhly wiſdom, in a true Examination concerning the wayes they live in and let that which is wrong be rejected and that which is right received; and in that which is Right will be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:44321:39"/>the Subtilty of the Serpent, <hi>That though they live unſeparated from Sin, yet they ſhall obtain Juſtification through Chriſt, and ſee a good End, or good brought forth through Sin be never finiſhed;</hi> this kind of Perſwaſion is through ſtrong Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Satan, whoſe workings are in a deep Myſtery of Iniquity in preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Godlineſs; but his End therein is, to make void that Bleſſed coming of Lord and Saviour to finiſh Sin, and to put an End to Unrighteouſneſs, and thereby to make way for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Everlaſting Righteouſneſs, that ſouls in that Bleſſed Principle of God may reſt in Peace.</p>
            <p>Now where this is not known, be Awakened, I beſeech you, unto Righteouſneſs, which is God's, and no otherwayes man's, but as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſtript of his own Eyes, and ſo comes before the Lord with a Broken and Contrite Spirit, and Heart hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at his ſight, who ſeacheth it by his Light, and ſhews to man in the Cool of the Day what beaſtly Imaginations are lodging therein; to the end, that

            <p>So let every one that names the Name of the Lord depart from Evil.

            <p>Come Idolaters, who are making Gods of Gold, and Silver, and Wood, and Stone, and ſo are bowing down to the works of your own hands; that

So leave your Folly in Bowing and Cring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>East,</hi> and to you know not what; and anſwer the Love of God in his Principle of Light in you, which makes manifeſt that which is Evil; and then will the Eye of your Underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be opened, to the beholding of him who fills Heaven and Earth with his Preſence, ſo that no Darkneſs can cover man from him, who is God of the <hi>North, South, Eaſt,</hi> and <hi>West;</hi> who will ſpoil your glorying, who are boaſting your ſelves of the Antiquity of your Religion, who firſt went from the Croſs, which is the Power of God, and ſo got up in a form of words, and then ſet the Croſs upon the Houſe, of <hi>Stone,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>Come you who live in Pride and Idleneſs, following the luſt of the Eye, the luſt of the Fleſh and Pride of Life, who live in fulneſs of Bread and Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs, Feaſting and making Merry over the pure Principle of God in you; this is a great Evil: therefore be admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed to mind that God in you, and Watch and Pray in the ſame, that ſo by that which is good of God, the Evil may be overcome, and the root and ground judged from whence all evil ſprings.</p>
            <p>Come all you Drunkards and Glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenous Perſons, who waſte and ſpoil the good Creatures, which are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the neceſſary uſe of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; read what is written in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.11, 12. What a miſerable life are you in who are attended with Wo and Miſery, who are ſo far ſeparated from the love of God in his Son, and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion that is therein to uſe and order all things aright, according to the

Come now, be perſwaded to mind that love of God which in the Cool, when the Drink is out, ſhews you what a great evil this is; which if not departed from, ruin is in that way both of Soul, Body and Eſtate.</p>
            <p>Come you Gameſters of all ſorts, who ſpend your time in Gaming and Sports, who are coveting an Increaſe by ſuch unequal and unjuſt wayes, and many ſpending their time in ſuch Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices, How many Families are ruined by ſuch a Courſe of Life? and what an evil example Parents thereby ſhew to their Children and Families? This is a great evil, ſuch being an ill ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour who are living therein, both to God, and man who fears God. Therefore be admoniſhed, to break off theſe evils by a true Repentance,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:44321:42"/>and learn to redeem time, that a Change may be witneſſed (before you go from hence) by vertue of the Power of Chriſt, which often moves againſt evil: ſo let not the juſt alwayes be reſiſted by the unjuſt; but if the juſt principle of God be minded and joyned unto, then will the unjuſt be overcome, and the juſt ſet up; in which all that dwell will be good ſavour in their day, and a good example to all.</p>
            <p>Come all you who are exalting a falſe Birth, where your Ears are ſtopt and your Eyes are cloſed, ſo that you have neither heard, nor ſeen, nor hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that which was from the beginning; even that word of Life (which ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life was with the Father, and was and is manifeſted to Believers) from whence Teſtimony is given of Gods love therein, where the true fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip is witneſſed in the Bleſſed Light of God; which all you, who are exalting a falſe Birth, do deſpiſe, and ſpeak very evilly of, or at leaſt, very ſlightly: So the true Heir hath been rejected, and not thought fit to

<pb n="59" facs="tcp:44321:43"/>God, which is to them that fear him, and love his appearance in the Heart, where the Light of his Bleſſed Spirit doth ſhew forth his goodneſs, from whence is Miniſtred forth life and ſtrength to the poor ſoul, ſtrengthning it againſt the appearance of evil: ſo the ſoul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made ſenſible of the Peace of God, and reſt through the Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his Holy Spirit, which cauſes joy and gladneſs to the Soul; having found a friend in its adverſity, it ſets a high value and eſteem of him, and is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be guided and directed by him. So the Harlot is ſeen, and the falſe Birth is ſeen, and the falſe Prophet which ſteals the true Prophets words is ſeen: ſo the Adultereſs may Cry long enough, and Scold long enough, and Peep and Mutter, all her Whine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in ſeeming Prayers, and Teaching Doctrines all end in filthineſs and ſin in her beſt duties; and yet this Impudent Harlot concludes, <hi>There is none like her; and her Birth is the true Birth; and all the reſt are falſe:</hi> But her deceit is manifeſt, and her Sorceries and

            <p>Come all you Ranters, who have gotten ſome words of Truth, but do uſe them in an exalted ſpirit, in which you are ſwimming up and down above the pure ſtream, which flows from the pure meek principle of God, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Water of Life, which comes from the Fountain of all good, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to drive away all filthineſs of Fleſh; where that hath paſſage, it refreſhes and keeps green and freſh, in a good ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to God and man. But you Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters having loſt its ſavour, are exalted above that which is lowly and good, being under a great Imagination of a knowledge of good and evil, on which, through the ſubtilty of the Serpent feeding you, are become dead to any true ſenſe of the Vertue that flows from the living Power, from whence through

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:44321:45"/>there make ſad noiſes, to prevent (if poſſible) the going forth of the Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Truth, as much as in them lyes; keeping people from a Reception thereof by their Babbling and Squal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to Diſturb Meetings, it having plainly appeared. But their Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being from the Vine of <hi>Sodom,</hi> diſobedience to that which they might be convinced of, being the cauſe from whence the firſt going out was; ſo the Root being corrupt, the Fruit is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt: ſo all in time grow dry and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, being an ill ſavour therein, and a ſtink whilſt they live herein up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth; ſo that both the way and end in that way is deſtructive. The which may ſerve for a warning to all who are convinced of the Truth, to take heed how they ſlight Gods love therein, in diſobeying that Principle of God in them, which is meek and lowly; and all that live in true Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to it, they live in ſafety, where evil in uncleanneſs cannot enter, nor haughtineſs hath no place there; but they that anſwer that Bleſſed Principle,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:44321:45"/>they riſe in its nature to hate unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and haughtineſs; ſo in its nature of meekneſs and lowlineſs, all who grow here bring forth good Fruit, which is a Bleſſed ſavour in his ſight, who is Creator of all; and all who are grafted into this root, and abiding therein, do feel ſap and nouriſhment from the ſame, whereby they ſpring, grow and flouriſh in a green, lively, ſenſible life of the exerciſe of God's love to mankind; and ſo dare not appear otherwiſe in the ſight of men, then they ſtand approved in his ſight who ſees all things: and ſo, meeting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to wait upon him, who hath all Power in Heaven and Earth, all gathering together in his Bleſſed Name, feeling true Refreſhment in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence: ſtrength there by is renewed to love God above all, and to love one another, and to watch for the good in one another; and to teſtifie againſt the evil, which may be an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of defiling or hurting any; ſtill waiting in meekneſs and love, to the end the good may be preſerved, and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:44321:46"/>that which is evil reſiſted: And though this love by many may be rejected, yet it is that which will carry them who are exerciſed therein above the head of all oppoſition; and preſerve them who keep their Habitation therein out of all extreams, even to finiſh their courſe with Joy and Peace in that Crown of Life which is everlaſting.</p>
            <p>Come all you who live in Envy, Hatred, Malice, Strife and Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Masters</hi> and <hi>Dames</hi> of <hi>Familes,</hi> who are in Branglings, and evil and raſh Speakings, and Diſcontents; theſe Fruits proceed from a corrupt and curſed ground; and ſo is an ill ſavour and bad example to your Families: This is a great evil.</p>
            <p>And all Children who are Stubborn and Heady, who do not obey your Parents, as it is meet in the Lord: This is a great evil.</p>
            <p>And all Servants who are not Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and Obedient in your ſeveral places, but are high-minded, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear Reproofs; but are ready to Anſwer again, and to be Diſquiet, and

               <p>NOw to the good in every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar is this writ, even that good Principle of God; by which if taken heed to, its nature is, to make mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that which is evil; and it will not in the leaſt agree with any thing that is evil: That is a Pearl indeed, which the Earthly mind and wiſdom hath kept people from the knowledge of.

And ſo the fear of offending God, by obeying his good gift, that is good, and out of evil; which is a true and right way to a clear underſtanding what to abſtain and Faſt from, and what to Pray in and for according to the will of God. So a Teſtimony of the everlaſting love of God in his way, which is perfect, many have received, where the Eye

Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this, and much more that is upon record, how ignorant are the many Sects and Parties of this way, by reaſon of the eſteem they have of darkneſs; wherein they being ignorant of God's Righteouſneſs, how in their blind zeal do they go about to eſtabliſh their own wayes and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and though no better then filthy Rags? So darkneſs that being over people, and in the dark, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt ways being ſet up, from whence ſin is let into the heart, and ſo the ſoul is in bondage to corruption; the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions being in the head, how giddy

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:44321:50"/>hath another Party exerciſed the ſame power, and ſo one after another? A corrupt fountain of Imaginations and Inventions being opened amongſt Apoſtates from the Truth: How in this night of darkneſs hath Envy, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and Hatred run currently, and drove Meekneſs, Holineſs and Truth quite out of doors? ſo the way of Truth that having been out, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment that was given forth in the way of God, <hi>To love him above all, and one another,</hi> that hath been out; the Sects and Parties having been blinded through ſin, in that blind <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domites</hi> eſtate, how have they (who have had the Names of <hi>Christians</hi>) been groping and feeling for the door which lets into Peace? but let them bring forth their experiences after twenty, fourty, ſixty years Tryal, ſome more, ſomeleſs; and don't think to cover your ſelves any longer with telling what you read of others ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences, whilſt you are reſiſting the juſt pure gift of God; for a day of ſearch is come, and coming: So
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:44321:50"/>Wo to them that cover, but not with God's Spirit.</p>
               <p>So all you <hi>Blind Guides,</hi> who are leading the blind, you muſt needs fall into the pit of deſtruction together, if you do not repent of your evil in refiſting the juſt principle of God in you. So do not think by your twining and twiſting in your wiſe definitions or diſtinctions about evil, whilſt you put <hi>good</hi> for <hi>evil,</hi> that you ſhall mend the matter thereby; for <hi>good</hi> is <hi>good,</hi> and that's of <hi>God,</hi> from whence all good comes; and <hi>evil</hi> is <hi>evil,</hi> and that's of the <hi>Devil,</hi> from whence all bad comes: So plain-deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is a Jewel, which many Honeſt hearts have ſought for, and have wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on God to be ſeaſoned therewith, which makes ſavoury in his ſight who is Creator of all, a Mighty power over all, whom all the Miniſters of Chriſt turned People to, that they might not continue in darkneſs, nor under Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's power; but that they might know his Light, who hath all Power
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:44321:51"/>in Heaven and Earth, and ſo to live ſubject under this higher Power, by which Power the true eye comes to be opened; and by a true under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is witneſſed God's love to the World in his Son Chriſt Jeſus, and what manner of love that was in that Bleſſed Act, in Suffering without the Gates of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> ſo in the ſame Will, which was the Sanctifier of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, Believers now are ſanctified and cleanſed from evil, to make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Name of the Lord in Truth and Righteouſneſs, in which there's no Evil. <hi>So let him that names his Holy Name depart out of evil, leaſt the good Spirit of God leave ſtriving with him, and ſo the ſoul be ſealed down in evil, where Tribulation and Anguiſh will never have an end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Come therefore be awaken'd, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, unto Righteouſneſs, <hi>and repent with that repentance never to be repented of,</hi> in ceaſing to do evil: And let the example of <hi>Nineveh</hi> be before you, <hi>Jonah</hi> 3.8, 9, 10. <hi>Cry mightily
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:44321:51"/>unto God; yea, let them turn every one from his evil way, and from the violence that is in their hands; who can tell if God will turn, and repent,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And God ſaw their Works, that they turned from their evil way, and God repented of the evil that he had ſaid, that he would do unto them, and he did it not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So this by the way; Faſt as long as you will, Pray as long as you will, Cry as loud as you will, if evil be not turned from, all will be vain: So evil, that is within man, and God's love hath been to make it manifeſt by the light of his Spirit within; ſo man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing convinced of, and reproved for evil, if he heeds not reproofs, but periſhes in his evil, then his deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is of himſelf; but if through this love of God, ſhed abroad in the hearts of people, they be awaken'd thereby, and ſo cleave to the good, and follow and obey it, then will that which was a Reprover for Evil, be an Inſtructer in a Bleſſed Life, where ſin
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:44321:52"/>nor evil can't enter (nor be) neither is there any agreement with darkneſs in that life in which there's no evil; but the ſoul being in this liberty, then, <hi>Come, I will tell you what the Lord hath done for my ſoul; and my ſoul, and all that's in me praiſes the Lord.</hi> So here's the Bleſſed Fountain opened, where the ſtreams of God's love are felt to run, which drive back the ſtreams of malice, uncleanneſs and abominations, which have corrupt mankind. So Bleſſed are they whoſe Eyes are to the Living Fountain, and wait for the riſing of the ſprings thereof in their hearts, from whence the truly thirſting ſoul comes to be ſatisfied, refreſhed and ſtrengthened, through a true ſenſe of the ſpringing up of this Well of Water, which he gives who hath all power in Heaven and Earth; the which Well of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſpringing unto everlaſting life, all being dipped or plunged under this, the ſoul comes to be waſhed from cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: and ſo made white as Snow; the which is an everlaſting ordinance,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:44321:52"/>ordain'd of God for a perpetual Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; the which all that would know Salvation through the remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſins, they muſt wait to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in this Bleſſed Covenant, where the Bleſſed Unity ſtands out of ſin; for there's no evil in this Covenant: So all that come to be concerned here, muſt firſt agree in their hearts to ceaſe from ſin and evil, and then to wait for the riſing of the Pure, and ſo to watch in the Pure againſt all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of that which is corrupt, and ſo to grow up in the Pure to a Bleſſed Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over the corruptible; and ſo in the pure meaſure of God's Spirit to receive and uſe the Creatures of God with Thankſgiving, where every Creature is good when they are ſo received: ſo to the Pure all things are Pure; but to the Defiled and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing there is nothing Pure: So the way of God, that is Pure and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled; and Bleſſed are they who are Undefiled and keep (and are kept) in that Bleſſed way to finiſh their dayes, where the Soul reſts in Peace
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:44321:53"/>with God, the which is the will of God (according to which is this writ) So to him be glory and honour, from the riſing of the Pure of himſelf, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever and for ever, <hi>Amen.</hi>

Come do not ſtop your Ears; Have you heard the voice of God or ſeen his ſhape? or are you ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of it, as they were who accuſed Chriſt, as if he was bearing falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Nay, come further; Have you not ſaid, <hi>That Revelations are ceaſed,</hi> and thereby ſhut up the way of the Kingdom of God, and from the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his Righteouſneſs by your wicked works, in going about to eſtabliſh your own Righteouſneſs, and works therein for term of life.</p>
            <p>Come you that have ſet up the Law and Covenant without (above the Law and Covenant within; are not theſe your own works? and have not
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:44321:57"/>they made you as blind as your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> that you can neither ſee nor hear?) but in your blind zeal are perſecuting Chriſt's near Relations, who follow him in their Generation, even by the drawings of his Father's Spirit unto Humility and Patience, who is the way, in whom God's Will was done: And did not Chriſt give Teſtimony of Relations, his Mother, his Brothers and Siſters, who did his Father's Will? And is not this to be done on Earth? And is it not the will of God that we ſhould ſpeak the Truth at all times, and that we ſhould be led and guided by the Spirit of Truth into all Truth? (is there any ſin in the guide:) And is not this Chriſt of God the ſame Anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Teacher, as he was in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the World? Was not he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Abraham</hi> was? And is not he the ſame yeſterday, to day and for ever, as he was in the beginning, who was <hi>David</hi>'s Lord, and the Holy mens Lord in all Ages? And is not he the Covenant by which all muſt come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:44321:57"/>God? Was he not given for a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and a Light to enlighten peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to be their Salvation, to lead and command his people? And muſt not his ſheep hear his voice? And is not he the ſame that he was in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning? And is not this the Precious tryed Stone, which the Wiſe Builders, building without, are confounded and ſtumble at, even the higheſt Notioniſts in the fleſhly Wiſdom, in their higheſt conceivings about the holy mens words? Come, examine your ſelves, and ſee whether Chriſt be not in you, except you be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates: You unbelievers, how hath the God of the World led you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and blinded you, that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee the Light of his Glorious Goſpel? Come ſee the cauſe; have you not been making Proviſion for the fleſh in the firſt place, and anſwering the Luſts thereof after the glory of the old World of ſin and iniquity? Hath not reſpect of perſons been in your Eye, and filthy lucre, and praiſe of men, and greeting in Market-places? Have
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:44321:58"/>you not preacht and prayed in your own wills, and run for gifts and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in your own wills? and is not all this Honour to be had below? And have you not ſought it before the Honour of God's work in your hearts? And is not this the cauſe of your Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of God's Kingdom, and his Righteouſneſs (Chriſt) and his Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, his Mother, Siſters and Brethren, who are ſanctified and bleſt through the will of God, where it is done in Truth and Righteouſneſs? and where that it is done, do not ſuch confirm in truth and reality all God's Bleſſed and holy works without in all generations? So do not envy and hate the people called <hi>Quakers,</hi> for maintaing the works of God's holy Spirit within them; for there are many of them have been as high Talkers of the works of God in holy men without, as you are; but found not ſuch Salvation, as to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſouls, and bodies, and eſtates, till we came to ceaſe from our own labours in our own willings and runnings; and ſo our hearts were bowed unto
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:44321:58"/>
               <hi>God's holy will</hi> in the deep ſilence of all fleſhly reaſonings and conſultations: So by the works of God's holy and bleſſed Spirit the way of God came to be made manifeſt in us; the which is a pure, Holy, undefiled way, Chriſt, the ſame yeſterday, to day, and for ever, as he was in the beginning without guile, without ſin; no iniquity is in him; he that is the hope of Glory, the great Myſtery made manifeſt in us <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who in former times, when without knowledge of him in the World, had Lords many, and Maſters many, and feigned Faiths and Beliefs concerning him many and divers: But when we were given up clearly to ſeek the Kingdom of God, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve of making proviſion for the fleſh, then the New <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> God's build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, came down from above, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all the Faithful, where no evil can be conceived, whoſe Children in her are made free from the Law of ſin and death; and this bleſſed City hath no need of the Sun, neither of the Moon to ſhine in it; for the Glory of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:44321:59"/>God doth lighten it, and the Lamb is the Light thereof. This bleſſed habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is prepared for God's people, who love the Light of his appearance, and delight to do his will.</p>
            <p>So away with all falſe Accuſations from all you falſe Accuſers of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple called <hi>Quakers,</hi> who ſay, <hi>we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be Saved by a righteouſneſs of our own, and by works of our own:</hi> If it were ſo, as you falſly and vainly do ſay, then might we not keep in the broad way, with you Hypocrites, who are gotten above the dayly Croſs, and ſo led about by the Thief above the door, where you Foxes, who are cunning in hunting about after others works, have holes enough to creep and cringe into to keep you in the glory of the World of ſin and iniquity, where you have had a long Trade in your imaginations, conceiving God's works in his bleſſed Inſtruments without you, whoſe Lines you have long made your boaſt of; ſo your Lyes are upon your own heads. For, this I teſtifie, and the Teſtimony is the ſame in thouſands, who are wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:44321:59"/>of the works of God's holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in ſome degree or meaſure, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is in Chriſt, God's Covenant, in which we hope for Salvation, and in no Covenant or Work of man's; and in this Covenant we are made a good ſavour unto God, and one unto another: And acceptance with God is obtained no other way but by the one pure offering, without ſpot or blemiſh, by the effectual workings of the Eternal Spirit, where the Blood of Chriſt is witneſſed to be ſufficient to purge Conſciences of dead works, and ſo to ſerve God in the New and Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing way, which he hath conſecrated for us through the Vail, his fleſh: And therefore all who are thus partakers of God's works, by the Revelation of God's Spirit, being true witneſſes of the Bleſſing of God in this one unſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted offering, we cannot but confeſs him before men, denying all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary offerings in mens wills, where their Garments are filled with ſpots and blemiſhes, and their Conſciences are defiled with dead works of their
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:44321:60"/>own Inventions and Works, the which having ſome outward ſhew of Holineſs may recommend unto man, who lives in the ſame, but not unto God; and therefore experience in the works of God's bleſſed Spirit hath taught us to deny them.</p>
            <p>And by this Chriſt of God, the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator of the New Covenant, we have Acceptance with God, from whence the knowledge of Salvation comes, by the Remiſſion of offences and ſins; and therefore we deny all falſe and vain Mediatorſhip of vain man in his works of Conceivings and Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning this Mediator; the which is really to be enjoyed and known by the effectual workings of God's Eternal Spirit, to the Conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Peace of Souls who partake thereof.</p>
            <p>And through the bleſſed Works of this bleſſed Spirit of God the deaf Ear comes to be opened, to hear the voice of the one true powerful Shepherd, who alone doth feed the Sheep of his Paſture with that convenient and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:44321:60"/>wholeſome Food, the which cauſeth ſoundneſs of Heart and Mind, and therein doth he take care to preſerve and keep his Sheep in a living ſenſe of his Love and Fatherly care, who calls to his Sheep when the Lion, the Woolf and the Bear appears, and ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them who take pleaſure in hearken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and obeying his voice. So to the one Shepherd and one Fold, Teſtimony is given, unto whom all that are erred and ſtrayed muſt return, if ever they witneſs deliverance from evil and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation from danger. So we deny all falſe Shepherds whoſe works of darkneſs tend to the ſcattering people in their minds and underſtandings from the ſenſe of God's Works in Chriſt, in reconciling loſt mankind, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them home unto himſelf (the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of all) of which the Law out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward was but a ſhadow of good things the which are enjoyed in this one Shepherd and Biſhop, who takes care and overſight of Souls; magnified and praiſed be his holy and glorious works of Redemption for ever and ever.</p>
            <pb n="94" facs="tcp:44321:61"/>
            <p>And ſo to the Honour of this one bleſſed Phyſitian of Souls, whoſe <hi>Works are certain</hi> and <hi>effectual,</hi> the which has been tryed by many wounded Souls, who could find no Cure without by the fooliſh and vain Phyſitians with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, who are meer Deceivers, and Daubers up of people through their Inchantments and Sorceries, by which they have made a long Prey of people through their fair Speeches, getting their Money through meer Deceit and Flattery, intruding into things they have no knowledge of, in which Works they are puft up above the pure holy Works of God's bleſſed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, the Revelation of which they have denyed, they in lew thereof have ſet up their own Imaginations and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivings in the Revelation of their Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular exalted Spirit, the Flattery and Deceit of which having taken with people, how are Nations corrupted by it? and what Miſery have theſe wicked Works brought into this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? God having given ſignal Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of diſlike unto them by Plague,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:44321:61"/>Fire and Sword, and by many Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers whom he hath drawn near un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to himſelf by his works, by the hands of them Meſſengers hath he ſent warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon warning, and exhortation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on exhortation, with tenders of his bleſſed works of reconciliation upon juſt and equal terms, of his enemies repenting, and turning unto him by turning from their wickedneſs: But what Entertainment theſe Servants of the Living God have found by theſe fooliſh Phyſitians, who are meer Time-ſervers for their own ends, whoſe refuge is an Arm of Fleſh to defend their wicked corrupt works, which have filled the Nations with their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filements, who by their Flatteries have drawn a Compliance from Magiſtrates, to puniſh the Meſſengers and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the moſt high God for telling the Truth from a certain knowledge of the works of God's Spirit of Truth, and therein teſtifying againſt the works of error and darkneſs. But the ſufferings that have been for this love of God in and through them who have
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:44321:62"/>been Inſtruments in his hands, may through ſearch be known; ſo Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is given againſt them, who are in the exaltation of works without, and denying the immediate bleſſed works of God's holy Spirit in its Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and Revelations of the Mind and Will of God unto wounded Souls within.</p>
            <p>And further concerning theſe bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed works of God's righteous holy Spirit, the which are attended with Peace, unto which way many have been turned; and becanſe ſome loiter, and are ſloathful, and yet remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted of the old man's corrupt words and deeds, and therefore not fit to put on the new man, Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus; and ſome who were in the way, do turn out of it again; and ſome fall head-long down to Perdition: Oh! what occaſion have the watchers for evil taken at this, and thereby ſet at nought God's works in his holy righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Spirit, and them that abide there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, making concluſions in their dark imaginary conceivings of the works
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:44321:62"/>of God, <hi>That he hath no ſuch perfect works now adayes; but that all are fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible and changeable:</hi> And ſo meaſure and weigh the things of God in their corrupt falſe meaſure and ballance, which things are Abomination in the ſight of God. So Teſtimony is given to God's bleſſed works, though many are ſo brittle that they will not abide them; yet notwithſtanding God's works in and through his holy Spirit of Truth, are righteous, holy, perfect in every degree and meaſure, and remains firm in goodneſs, and unchangeable, there being no ſpot nor blemiſh in them, the which praiſes them for ever, out of which none ſhall ever find accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of him. Mutter, peep, whine and ſcold as long as you will, your works of darkneſs muſt down, which have corrupted the Nations, which is cauſe of the great Judgments paſt in this Nation, and the greater yet to come; For the Sword of the Spirit, the Word of God, is gone out againſt wicked workers and works; and thus ſaith the Lord, <hi>No Peace to the wicked,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:44321:63"/>their prayers are abomination in my ſight.</hi> So whatſoever your profeſſions and coverings therein be, of your talkings and imaginations concerning the gift of God, which is Life Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, you being really out of it, in your own imaginary parts and gifts, in comprehending the works done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out you, and ſo not ſenſible of any real, perfect, pure work of God's holy Spirit in you, the which is the cauſe you are ſo dark, and wickedly blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to plead for ſin, the which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with the wages of death; the cauſe of death being ſin, the which remaining, the effects cannot ceaſe, even death and corruption from that venomous ſting over all fleſh that is corrupted with it. So for ſhame leave your falſe Accuſations againſt an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent people, called by the Name of <hi>Quakers,</hi> for teſtifying of the works of God's holy Spirit, the which are perfect in every degree, and therefore there is not the leaſt ſin nor evil in them. So all you who ſay, <hi>You are not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin in your beſt duties;</hi> I ſay, they

So over all the works and powers of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in our Faith and Belief, that the holy righteous works of God's bleſſed Spirit ſhall be exalted, and the God of Truth in and through his bleſſed works, in preparing and fitting the hearts of people, the knowledge of him ſhall increaſe, till it ſpread over all. And for this purpoſe hath God raiſed many, contrary to the wiſdom of the World, in whom he hath made

            <p>And now all you Leaders of the People, in all forms and faſhions, who are denying the works of the Divine Power of God in its bleſſed operation and powerful workings, in ſetting free them who are heavy laden and weary through the enemies works of ſin and iniquity, the which you ſay <hi>cannot be overcome;</hi> therefore you are denyers of the ſufficiency of God's works and his kingdom, wherein dwells righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, peace and joy, in and through effectual workings of God's holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; the which, though you ſay in

But being ſayers, and not doers, you are ſo darkened that with all your own wills and mights you are ſtrengthening the old King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of tranſgreſſion, where ſin and iniquity aboundeth, the Devil's works: Was it not by reaſon of tranſgreſſion that the firſt Law, the firſt Covenant, was added, which was written in Tables of Stone?

            <p>Now all you blind Leaders of the blind, is not here God's ſecond Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, writ in the heart, into which all muſt come that come unto God, where his Light is to ſhine, who is the <hi>True Light that enlightens every man that comes into the World?</hi> And if this righteous Law be taken heed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, will it not judge Luſt when it riſes in the heart?

And muſt not all that come to <hi>Sion,</hi> the City of the Living God, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed through theſe righteous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? And all that will not come under this righteous Law and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where Mercy and Peace kiſſes, and Truth and Righteouſneſs is ſet over all; is it not juſt that they be left to Judgment without Mercy? So is not Deſtruction from Self-willing and

And is not the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of every Soul in and through the righteous Decrees, and juſt and holy Laws of God, which is Light in every Conſcience?

But underneath theſe coverings are the ſame wicked hands by which the Juſt hath ſuffered, and been rejected, and ſet at nought in all Ages.</p>
            <p>And through the bleſſed works of the Light of God's holy Spirit theſe corrupt workers and works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs being diſcovered, and a Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Teſtimony in Thouſands that ſtand

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:44321:71"/>with Fire and the holy Spirit, to burn and conſume Luſts, and ſo to bring down every high Thought and vain Imagination under his Feet, who is the Lamb of God that takes away the ſins of the World? And ſo by that one pure holy Spirit of God are many bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized into one Body, where God's will is done on Earth by him that abides forever. So not by the works of man, is any ſaved, but by the merciful works of God in his Son, by the waſhing of Regeneration, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of the holy Spirit. So into this pure holy Name muſt all be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, dipped, plunged, the which tends to the bringing out of all falſe Fellowſhips, into that one and only Pure Fellowſhip, <hi>to walk in the Light of the Lord, where the Blood of Chriſt cleanſes from all ſin:</hi> A pure Baptiſm indeed, a pure Waſhing in a pure Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, where filthineſs that is within man comes to be waſhed away, and thereby way is made for the comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table freſh ſprings that riſe from the Fountain of Love and Mercies, (the

So to this bleſſed work, who muſt increaſe, his Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is given; and againſt all the works of men's hands, the which tend to the making void thereof. So the Fountain of God ſtands ſure, and muſt do forever; and all falſe foundations, whereon people have built, muſt be ſwept away for evermore.</p>

               <p>And now to the praiſe and honour of God Almighty, who hath drawn thouſands by the ſtrivings of the grace of his holy Spirit to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his way, Chriſt, the Truth, Way and Life, the which is without ſpot and blemiſh, the ſame pure, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and unchangeable Way and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation on which the holy men of God were built in Ages and Generations paſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.20. and are built upon the Foundation of Apoſtles and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the chief Corner-Stone. So here was the Primitive <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Foundation, from whence proceeded and proceeds Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, bleſſed and gracious words, from the true ſenſe and feeling of the operation and powerful works of God's holy and bleſſed Spirit: And from this holy, uncorruptible, pure Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and way of God were all true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters

               <p>So here lyes the difference between true Teaching and Teachers, (and falſe.) The true Teaching being the anointing of God's holy Spirit and Power, wherewith mankind being anointed, and taught of God, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to God's bleſſed will therein, in a croſs to his own Carnal Will and Affections, ſpeaking forth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering the Truth unto people, as it is in Jeſus Lord of all, in whom the Peace is, and from whom Peace is proclaimed under thoſe Conditions and Qualifications as it pleaſes him to make and tender, who is Lord of all. The falſe Teaching is that Spirit of Iniquity, the old Deceiver of the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:44321:74"/>World, the Serpent that worked and wrought under a Myſtery, ſubjecting mankind unto his will under a vain hope, through which he beguiled him at firſt, drawing out a Compliance of his Will unto his deluſions, and ſo to tranſgreſs the bleſſed commands of his Maker; through which yielding of mankind unto the Serpent's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, they became Tranſgreſſors of God's holy Law and Covenant; and for that cauſe was drove from God's Preſence, and then Fear entered; and Trouble and Sorrow entered by man's yielding to the Traytor, by which means he partook of the Nature of his Curſed works; and being thus drove out of the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> the Lord placed a Flaming Sword, which turned every way to keep the way of the Tree of Life.</p>

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:44321:81"/>God's good and holy Spirit are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as a Sealed Book, ſo that they who have exalted their parts and knowledge in <hi>Hebrew, Greek</hi> and <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> above the pure Life of Jeſus, they can't read in it, becauſe it is ſealed; and theſe Learned men (unlearned in the things of God) can't read in it, becauſe they draw near to God with their Mouths, and ſeem to honour him with their Lips, but their Hearts not being right in his ſight, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are the wiſdoms confounded, and underſtanding in the Things of God kept from them.</p>
               <p>So its ſuch who have nothing to Miniſter from but a divination of their own Brain, in conceivings and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations concerning the works of God in others, but from no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his works in themſelves; ſo they run and Divine for Money, and Gifts and Rewards in that adulterated whoriſh Spirit, which hath ſate a long time, and reigned over people, who have been as unſtable and unſettled as Waters, reeling and ſtaggering to and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:44321:81"/>fro through the Sorceries and Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft of that whoriſh wicked ſpirit, into which Cup the Kings of the Earth have drunk, and been made drunk with Envy, Malice and Hatred one againſt another; and from Luſts, which have been conceived in that wicked and untimely womb, have proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Wars, and Fighting, and Hatred one againſt another, and alſo hatred againſt the appearance of God's good works in others.</p>
               <p>So its againſt that bad and wicked ſpirit, which is not to ſpeak in the Church, that I am moved to give Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in and through the operation of God's good and holy ſpirit, the which is mightily at work this Day, wherein his power is made manifeſt to deſtroy the Devil's works, and ſo a way mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the pouring forth of God's holy and bleſſed ſpirit more and more upon all fleſh; from whence I believe there are at preſent hundreds of Able and Gifted Miniſters in this Nation, in ſome degree or meaſure or other of God's holy ſpirit, who can ſpeak ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:44321:82"/>of what they have felt, handled, taſted and ſeen of his works thererein, who is the <hi>beginning and ending of every good and perfect work and gift, in and for them, who wait to know his will and do it:</hi> And through theſe bleſſed works muſt the wounded and diſtracted Nations be healed and ſet to rights; and all that hinder theſe bleſſed works of God's holy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited ſpirit, they are enemies to God, and to their own ſouls, and to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Country where they live.</p>

            <p>Come, be awakened, and hearken; where do you find (by the example or Doctrine of Chriſt Jeſus, who is Lord of all, and hath all power in Heaven and Earth,) or do you read of any ſuch works afore-mentioned, done by him or his Followers? No, no, you have betrayed him, who call him Lord, and yet live in ſuch works of malice and revenge; he taught, and teaches quite contrary, even to learn of him, who is meek and lowly in heart, admoniſhing all to <hi>love one another, and to do good for evil, and to love enemies;</hi> who dwell with them that are of a contrite and humble ſpirit, who teaches the humble and meek, and who waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and cleanſeth his Followers from their filth, as in dayes paſt, ſo to day and for ever. Oh you betrayers of him, who have rendred him a hard Maſter, in that you deny him; for he

So all you betrayers of the juſt, holy principle of Light and Life in your hearts, be awakened; come, ſee what a Dream you have been in, and what Dreamers you have followed, who are out of the way of the Lord, and yet for lucre ſake, by art and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, keep people confeſſing they are out of the way of the Lord, perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding its not to be found, or as if there were no ſuch thing.</p>

            <p>Come, don't ſtop your Ears, and ſhut your Eyes, it will be all in vain; for he that is Lord, Maſter and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of all, ſees and beholds all, you can hide nothing from him, and he will call you to an account; then, what can the betrayers ſay?</p>
            <p>Oh, you whoſe dayes are not quite over, conſider what you are a doing, and what you are a treaſuring up; malice, envy and hatred are from a

            <p>Come, be awakened, ceaſe to do evil, then learn to do well, if happily you may obtain mercy; reſtore the pledge and repent: Keep nothing back that hath been taken by violence.</p>
            <p>Be awakened, and ſee how filthy your hands are, through Malice and Cruelty, which hath brought a filthy ſmell and curſe upon your Eſtates; a ſad portion for your Children, for their Fathers to die with their Eſtates entailed in the Curſe, the which can never be removed, from Father or Child, till the cauſe of the Curſe be repented of, and done away, and ſo the hands waſted in innocency; until which time every one ſhall bear his own iniquity, becauſe of the accurſed thing that is in their hands.</p>

            <p n="3">III. Theſe Prieſts having denyed the Revelation of Chriſt's Spirit now adayes, and ſet up the Letter and Law without above the Spirit and Law within, by which its plain and evident, that they are Strangers to the great Love of God in his New Covenant, and being void of the knowledge of the gift of God to the World, they have nothing but Imaginations and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions of their own Brain-ſtudy, and out of others Works and Labours, therefore we do deny them.</p>

            <p n="6">VI. Foraſmuch as Chriſt hath ſaid, <hi>John</hi> 10. <hi>All that ever came before me are Thieves and Robbers,</hi> or as it may be rendred, <hi>All that go before him;</hi> (Now mind) <hi>before</hi> Abraham <hi>was he was,</hi> and before the Prophets were he was; ſo the true Prophets they did not go before him, they waited for the Signification of Chriſt's Spirit, which was in them, the which was their Foundation, and this was the Apoſtles Foundation, and the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in the Primitive time were built upon the ſame; but the Thieves and Robbers were the falſe Prophets and Prieſts that came before him, who ſteal the true Prophets words, and uſe
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:44321:90"/>them in their Divination for Money, and Rewards, and Preaching for Hire, the which were wicked practices, teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied againſt, and cryed out againſt by the true Prophets; among which wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed practices we finding the man-made Miniſters in this Age and Generation, who go before Chriſt, and being of that number Chriſt Jeſus ſpoke againſt, therefore we deny them.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. All take notice, that the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony againſt Prieſts that preach for Hire is no new thing of twenty or thirty years ſtanding, as ſome do vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imagine; thoſe abominable practices were teſtified againſt by the true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; read <hi>Micah</hi> 3. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 66. <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13. <hi>Hoſea</hi> 6. and read Chriſt's Teſtimony againſt Hirelings, <hi>John</hi> 10. (and mind) all the holy men of God were and are of the ſame mind. And for Prieſts and People now adayes to pretend to Coſpel-order and Goſpel-dayes, and to live in the ſame, and if not worſe practices then the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Prieſts, Teachers and People, who were before the more powerful
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:44321:91"/>manifeſtation of Chriſt to fleſh, the everlaſting Goſpel, <hi>who is the end of the Law for Righteouſneſs to all that believe;</hi> this is a very great ſhame even to the name of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and the falſe Teachers the Prieſts being the Leaders into theſe Abominations; therefore we do deny them.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. <hi>Paul</hi> an Apoſtle of Jeſus, he did exhort the then Believers, to follow him as he was a follower of Chriſt, who ever was, and is a bleſſed Leader out of Tranſgreſſion, out of ſin, and therefore out of Strife and Contention; he taught and teaches to love enemies, for this Cauſe was and is the love of God in his Son ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in fleſh, even to condemn ſin in the fleſh, and to deſtroy the Devil's works of Malice, Envy, Luſt, Pride, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, Covetouſneſs, Lying, Guile, Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, Deceit, Fraud, Vain Worſhips, Vain Services, Perſecution, and all other Abominations that may be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; the true and faithful witneſs, even the Light of his holy Spirit in mankind, never did nor will aſſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:44321:91"/>to any thing that is evil. And for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as the Prieſts are led by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Spirit, and acted by another Spirit, as by their Fruits and Practices they are manifeſted, even to be led by the ſpirit of <hi>Cain,</hi> he being the firſt Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor about Religion; and the Prieſts being in the ſame ſteps of Perſecution, they may ſay if they ſpeak truly, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, be you followers of us as we are fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of our fore-Fathers,</hi> Cain, <hi>the falſe Prophets and Teachers in Ages paſt;</hi> they bringing forth the ſame Fruits, therefore of neceſſity they muſt ſpring from the ſame corrupt ground and root; and therefore let all the wiſe in heart judge, whether we have not good cauſe to deny them.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. It hath been ſo from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, that he that was born after the Fleſh, perſecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even ſo it is now; and when we turned our backs upon ungodlineſs, and waited in the grace of God, that we might live godly and righteouſly in this preſent evil World, we did believe we might ſuffer by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:44321:92"/>reaſonable ungodly men, who live ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted above the Grace of God, of which number the Prieſts are chief; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we deny them.</p>
            <p n="10">X.

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:44321:106"/>may be opened and cleared from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and error, that the things which concerns your everlaſting peace may be witneſſed, before you go from hence and ſhall be ſeen no more.</p>
               <p>The 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20, 21. <hi>Knowing this firſt, that no Prophecy of the Scripture is of any private interpretation. For the Prophecy came not in old time by the Will of man: But holy men of God ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Now mind, ſince the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies in Scripture is of no private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation; let all who would not be ſuppoſed to be of that number, who are giving their private Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of thoſe weighty and high con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, conſider what Spirit they are led and acted by therein. For as much as thoſe weighty concerns cannot be underſtood, but by the univerſal love and mercy of God in and through the manifeſtation of the Light of his holy Spirit, given to every man to profit withall: Therefore all had need to conſider, whether they feel and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the mind and will of God
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:44321:106"/>through the manifeſtation of his bleſſed Spirit, leading and guiding them into the knowledge of thoſe Propheſies aforeſaid: And if this love of God in the manifeſtation of his Spirit, be not taken heed unto, and received and uſed for that end it is given; all they who neglect it can give no other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the Propheſies, but what they conceive in their private Conceptions, the which is a danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Eſtate; the Propheſies being deep things, wherein the great Salvation of the Lord unto mankind is ſignified; and this goodneſs and mercy of the Lord is only revealed by his Spirit, as ſaid the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10. <hi>But God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit, for he ſearcheth all things, yea, the deep things of God.</hi> So its by taking heed unto the manifeſtation of the bleſſed gift of God (by which the love and mercy of God were witneſſed unto by the holy men of God) that the Scriptures of Truth come to be clearly underſtood: And this Spirit of God giving to man kind light and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:44321:108"/>him; neither can he know them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> Therefore it is of neceſſity for all to take heed to the Revelation and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of Gods holy Spirit in them, if ever they come to a true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the love and mercy of God teſtified unto in old time: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it's good for all to conſider what ſtate they are in, whether in a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or ſpiritual, whether in a capacity to receive an underſtanding in the things of God teſtified of in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or whether in a natural eſtate wreſting them to their own deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: In that ſtate what falſe concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about the things of God are brought forth, the which genders to bondage and corruption.</p>
               <p>And in this Worldly wiſdom, what diverſity of Inventions do people get, make and find out, to keep them from the Croſs which Chriſt exhorted his followers to take up dayly and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him? Though this may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as fooliſhneſs to them that periſh; yet as ſaid the Apoſtle, <hi>But
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:44321:108"/>unto us that are ſaved, it's the power of God.</hi> It was not the intent in the moving of God's holy Spirit (in holy men, in giving forth thoſe bleſſed Teſtimonies of God's righteouſneſs and love therein unto the world) that people in their carnal minds and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural eſtates, ſhould cover their unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs therein, and deck and trim themſelves therewith for ſome ſelfiſh advantage; the which are very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous ſins that have gotten do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion in the hearts of thoſe who do account themſelves Leaders of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: And indeed if the people did not love to have it ſo, they would bow to the manifeſtation of God's love and mercy in them: But being contrary minded, then to yeild to the good will and pleaſure of God in the mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his good Spirit; how greatly do they provoke the Lord of Heaven and Earth in grieving and vexing of his holy Spirit? as ſaid the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> in another Caſe, 63.10. <hi>But they rebelled and vexed his holy Spirit; therefore he was turned to be their enemy,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:44321:109"/>and he fought againſt them:</hi> In that ſtate it's a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the Living: I do therefore beſeech all to be conſiderate in this weighty concern, wherein the Souls Immortal are ſo deeply concerned, and let not the day of God's Viſitation in and by the ſtriving of his good Spirit paſs over your heads, leaſt you be left mourning and grieving without God in the World, and ſo without any certain hope of all the Saints and Sanctified in the Truth: And through the bleſſed operation and revelation of the holy Spirit of Truth, he is now the hope of all them, who are real denyers of that which hath a tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of grieving and quenching his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit; and in this is Chriſts Doctrine obeyed, in denying that which is contrary to the will of God, whoſe bleſſed will is the ſatisfaction of all; and for that end hath he given of his good Spirit unto all, the which ought to be taken unto by all.</p>
               <p>The gain-ſaying of the ſtriving there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, was the cauſe of the Worlds over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:44321:109"/>of old; in that they grieved his good Spirit, and therein provoked the Lord of Glory, till in his hot diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, he ſaid, <hi>his Spirit ſhould not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſtrive with them:</hi> And the cauſe of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> Crucifying the Lord of Glory by their wicked hands, was by their doing deſpite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gods holy Spirit, they being ſtiff Necked, did reſiſt the moving and ſtriving of Gods holy Spirit, as their Fathers did before them, which brought thoſe ſad and miſerable Calamities (which may be read of) upon them. And that which was the cauſe of Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance in Dayes, Ages and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations paſt; is now the cauſe of great ignorance in which the people living in error know not the Scriptures, nor the power of God; and for want of the knowledge thereof, people do periſh.</p>
               <p>Thus plain and evident it is to all who have the Eyes of their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings opened, that they who are true owners of the Scriptures, their ſenſe and knowledge thereof comes by the moving of the Spirit of Chriſt,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:44321:110"/>who lighteth every man that comes into the world, unto which the true Goſpel Miniſters turned people, even from darkneſs that was in them, unto the Light that was in them; which Light that ſhineth in Darkneſs, and the Darkneſs comprehendeth it not. In this principle of the Light of Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, which makes manifeſt the Deeds of Darkneſs, muſt all believe, and obey, that come to find Life and Peace: And read <hi>John</hi> 1.1. what is there ſaid concerning the word of God, by which all things were made, the which the Devil is out of; though he may get the words, and talk and preach of the word: But being out of the word of God, he cannot preach that: <hi>He that can receive it, let him; for in him the word by which all things were made, is Life; and the Life is the Light of men:</hi> And for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhining and breathing forth of this Light out of Darkneſs, muſt all wait in the Self-denyal of all dark works, taking up the Croſs dayly thereunto; that Life and Immortality may be
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:44321:110"/>brought to Light through the Goſpel: And if this be hid: <hi>It is hid to them that are loſt, In whom the God of this World hath blinded the minds of them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not,
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3, 4.</note> leaſt the light of his glorious Goſpel of Chriſt, who is the Image of God, ſhould ſhine upon them.</hi> And whilſt this love of God teſtified unto through the Scriptures, remains hid; what true benefit can ſuch be ſuppoſed to have of the Scriptures, though they may be never ſuch high Talkers and Profeſſors thereof: Oh that people would conſider what they are doing, that they may not labour and travail all their days in vain, and lye down in ſorrow at laſt.</p>
               <p>Come, be ſober, be wiſe you Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the Scriptures, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that it is witten: <hi>For we muſt all appear before the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeat of Christ;

               <p>But unto what a degree of groſs darkneſs are people plunged into, through a great night of Apoſtaſie; where concluſions are made, that the Operation, Revelation and Inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Spirit of Chriſt is ceaſed now adays. They may as well ſay, Chriſt
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:44321:124"/>hath now adays no followers, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore none are true Chriſtians; the many Sects and Opinions have gotten varieties of Baptiſms, but all out of the Spirit of Chriſt: That is ceaſt (they ſay) now adays, the operation and work thereof was fulfill'd in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive dayes. Now every one to his private Interpretations, and build ſome <hi>Babel;</hi> the Nations are now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as waters, and the Whore with her Golden Cup of Sorceries rids over all; and the Nations have drunk of her Cup of Fornications, and are made ſo drunk therewith, that they ſee no need of the Revelation of Chriſt's Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit now adays: Their Mother Myſtery, <hi>Babylon</hi> the Mother of Harlots; ſhe inſtructs her brood of Children to kindle fires of Confeſſion and Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, without true Faith and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of what bleſſed Teſtimonies are left upon record, and to warm them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by the ſparks of their fire; and to cover themſelves with the Harlots Attire, even their own ſelf-righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in ſeigned Faiths, and feigned

<pb n="222" facs="tcp:44321:125"/>from under the man of ſin's power, and ſo cleanſed from the filthy Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſin: Then indeed the Lord had a people the which were his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed poſſeſſion, being ſanctified throughout in Soul, Body and Spirit, by the pouring out and renewings of Chriſts holy Spirit: They were not their own, being purchaſed and bought with a price; they all confeſſed unto the Lord that had bought them, and all the true Preachers of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they preacht up then the ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of the Blood of the Lamb, and the uncorruptable word of life, and laboured and travelled for the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt in the Believers, that they might preſent them perfect in Chriſt Jeſus: All this ſaith the Seed of the bond-woman, where Miſtery <hi>Babylon</hi> hath her brood; we cannot deny but that the ſtate and condition of the Primitive Chriſtians were as aforeſaid: But they may ſay, if they will ſpeak the Truth, our Mother Miſtery <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> hath taught us another Leſſon now adays: Alas, for you our fore-Fathers,

                  <hi>Demas</hi> and the Antichriſtian Spirit, that led abundance from among the true Chriſtians; many in the Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Spirit went out and imbraced this World, and in the Wiſdom thereof, the God of the World blinded our our Fore-fathers Minds, and then the Goſpel was hid, and in the Apoſtacy we grew, being inwardly ravened from the Spirit of Chriſt, we loſt the ſenſe of the ſufficiency of the power thereof: Then the Spirit of Antichriſt that led and became head, and the Beaſt, and falſe Prophet, with many Heads and Horns, ſome like a Lamb, having received power from the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, became in time ſuch a great head and mountain, that they made War with the true Woman and her Seed, and caſt out floods of ungodlineſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that Birth and Seed that was conceived by the free Woman; and in ſuch a degree the Beaſt prevailed, that he proclaimed open War; ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who is able to make War with the Beaſt: Thus the Seed of the bond Woman, who are conceived and

Alas for you, your worth is the product of ruine and miſery; that which you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to your peaceable Neighbours (will come upon your ſelves,) your own works in your ſingular exalted ſpirits is the purchaſer thereof.

Now if the Revelation, Operation and Divine Inſpiration thereof be ceaſed, then tell me by what ſpirit Chriſtians, ſo called, are Baptized into ſo many Bodyes and Fellowſhips, and what Spirit rules and governs? And what difference there is between them called Heathen in their Fellowſhips, and them called Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in their Fellowſhips, where the Authority, Rule and Government of Chriſts Spirit is denyed.</p>
               <p>Come to plain dealing, and don't Shuffl; you have been long enough in that work already; and the more you perſiſt therein, the more you will be confounded, and the deeper plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the horrible pit, and your Feet will be faſter ſtuck in the Mire: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be admoniſhed to deal plainly, leaſt you be your own Executioners through your high preſumptuous mindedneſs in bringing ſwift deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon you; for of a Truth thouſands have been bowed before the Lord un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſenſe of their own inſufficiency to perform that which is good and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:44321:131"/>of themſelves, and have tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly waited upon the Lord in a deep ſilence of the fleſh: And indeed Chriſt hath appeared the ſecond time in his bleſſed Spirit and power, and hath quickened and revived many hungry Souls, and he hath made known his ſufficiency and help in the needful time. And all them who have in Truth laid hold of him, cannot part with him; for it's by him that we can do all things well pleaſing and acceptable in the ſight of God and man: And all that have begun in this Spirit, and are faithful and obedient thereunto, have Hope, Faith and Confidence to grow up and be made perfect thereby; and ſo attain to the mark and prize that is before us: Though many may and do turn aſide through unfaithfulneſs and diſobedience, and the many and great tryals that may be met withall, through the Oppreſſion and Cruelty of the Worlds Spirit; yet over all that hath been, and may be met withall; we have Hope and Faith, that in and through the aſſiſtance of the Spirit and

               <p>And further, concerning the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goings of this bleſſed ſpirit, I do teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie my Faith therein; that the Lord of Heaven and Earth will by the Majeſty and power thereof, overturn, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, overturn the power of darkneſs, and deſtroy all the curſed fruits that have ſprung from the corrupt root and ground thereof: And by the light of the ſpirit of Chriſt Jeſus, a ſight is given to many faithful witneſſes, that the Ax of the Lord is laid to the root thereof: And the Lord of Heaven and Earth that hath begun the work, will carry it on, and perfect it, to his own praiſe, honour and glory; and to the eſtabliſhment of his purchaſed poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, where he Tabernacles and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights to dwell forever.</p>

This makes the corrupt and falſe Teachers of the Nation, who are made ſo by man in the Worlds ſpirit and wiſdom, being drawn out for filthy Lucre ſake; and in more then ordinary manner, coveting after Silver and Gold; this makes theſe Diviners mad: The day of Chriſt being ſo clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come, and the man of ſin (their Maſter) ſo clearly revealed, and a Teſtimony ſo clearly goes out againſt them; that their Maſter the man of ſin in all his Transformations, though he

And this is coming to paſs, and muſt be fulfilled, glory, praiſes and honour be given to the Lord God forever.</p>
               <p>And thus unprejudiced Reader, who hath ſome Breathings after the knowledge of the Lord, and canſt not take up a reſt in a ſinful ſtate, but deſires that true Judgment may go forth: Here is plain Truth, and alſo ſome brief inſtances therein, which is but few to what might be given from <hi>Geneſis</hi> to the <hi>Revelations,</hi> of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Spirits motions, and their Effects; and of the bleſſed motions of Gods good Spirit, and their Effects; by which thou mayeſt ſee, by the fruits and practices, who are of that brood and generation of <hi>Cain</hi> and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers; and who are of the generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Abel</hi> and his followers: And what a wicked, proud, arrogant Spirit that is, which dares preſume to limit the
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:44321:137"/>moving of Gods holy Spirit in its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, Operation and Divine Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. And by which wicked and preſumptuous works, that proud, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious and aſpiring Spirit, hath turned the very end and tendency of the love and mercy of God in the moving of this holy Spirit through holy Men, in giving forth thoſe bleſſed Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and Propheſies in Scriptures, even quite to another uſe, then intended.</p>
               <p>And how the Antichriſtian Spirit, which was in the World in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles dayes, wrought in a Miſtery of Iniquity, and in Confeſſions and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions from the true witneſſes Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; that Chriſt was come into the World, and how he was Born, and how he Suffered, and was Aſcended, and will come again (which is all true.) But under this fair covering, the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of <hi>Babylon</hi> ſet up their Trades, and fraighted their Veſſels with the Whores Trumpery, and with fair Speeches and good Words, out of the Life, out of the Power; they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded poor Souls, making Merchandize
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:44321:138"/>of them; ſetting up that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable in the way of righteouſneſs, for the way of righteouſneſs; and ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the ſecond coming of Chriſt in Spirit to them that look and wait for him without ſin unto Salvation: This great miſtery, the which is Chriſt in us the hope of Glory, the way of Truth and Life, the way of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs unto the Father, out of which none can come unto him; this by their Arts they have wholly excluded: And thus having ſet the Scripture for a chief rule, and only rule of Life; they have excluded the Spirit of Truths guide and leadings, the which the Scripture directs unto; and ſo ſet the Scriptures above the Spirit, by the moving of which they were given forth: And the Words and Writings of the Scripture, they have ſet up, for the word it ſelf. And this Spirit hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put the Declaration and Writings of <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke</hi> and <hi>John</hi> for the Goſpel; here the Goſpel, the power of God, that is excluded, and Chriſt the word of God in the heart
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:44321:138"/>and mouth, that is excluded: And thus having turned the Scripture up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide down; <hi>The man of ſin, the Son of Perdition;
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.3.</note> who oppoſeth and exalteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf above all that is called God; ſitteth in the Temple of God, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf that he is God:</hi> And now ſaying in effect, that the day of Chriſt is paſt, as touching his appearance and coming in the fleſh, he is at a remote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or diſtance from his people. Now Revelations are ceaſed, ſay they, and the beſt term they can give the Light in man, is to call it a Natural Light: So Natural and Brutiſh is man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind become, through the works of the enemy; and in this Natural State, reading the Scriptures, having put the moving of Gods Spirit a far off from them, by which alone the things of Cod therein are underſtood: They in that Natural Eſtate, doth not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what they read, neither can they receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſs unto them: Oh people be admoniſhed to
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:44321:139"/>come down to the Light of Chriſt in you, that makes manifeſt the deeds of Darkneſs; and as the man of ſin comes to be revealed in you, by the Light of Chriſts Spirit, you thereby will come to the knowledge of Chriſts day and coming in righteouſneſs, to make War againſt all unrighteouſneſs, and to put an end to tranſgreſſion, and finiſh ſin, and bring in everlaſting righteouſneſs: So away with all pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Interpretations and vain Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and come to the univerſal love of God that Spirit or Light; the which makes manifeſt that which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveable, and turn at his reproof, and he will pour out his Spirit upon you: And thus by the coming of the day of Chriſt, the day of the wicked will be ſeen, and the Bed of Torment they muſt lye down in, who go on in wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, oppoſing the Spiritual ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Chriſt Jeſus: Oh ſad will their day be, who perſiſt in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of mocking and ſcoffing at the moving of Gods holy Spirit now adayes; that is a proud arrogant Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:44321:139"/>which will lead all that follow it to the end, to miſery, contempt and ſhame; and at length to everlaſting deſtruction. Bleſſed are they that are not defiled with it: And therefore be admoniſhed to put your whole truſt in God; and wait for the appearance of his grace, that you may have Salt and Savour in your ſelves; or elſe, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding you may talk high things of what you read in Scriptures, yet if you be not regenerated and born of the Spirit, you cannot enter into the Kingdom of God. And thus in the Leading, Guiding, Operation, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation and Divine Inſpiration of the Bleſſed Spirit of Truth, am I mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to give Teſtimony to the Truth and way of Life and Peace, in true love to all the Creation of God, for the undeceiving of deceived and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded Souls, that their underſtandings may be cleared of Darkneſs and Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; and that they may know the Truth as it is in Jeſus, and be ſaved.</p>

            <p>IN the everlaſting Seed, Power and Life, keep the ſubſtance of all ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified in Ages paſt, under many Types, Figures and Shadows, now known and dwelt in by them who have believed the good report of the holy men of God, which is left upon record, who was redeemed from the Earthly part; even that they might be Gods witneſſes of his Heavenly gift, wherein is all the Treaſures of wiſdom and knowledge hid; which Treaſure hath been freely opened un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, who through faithfulneſs and diligent waiting, have expected the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:44321:141"/>ſame, as a ſure reward of the bounty and goodneſs of our Creator for ever. So that all the obedient and upright hearted can truly ſay, for ever be the day had in remembrance, when we were awakned out of Carnal Security, we had in vain Cuſtoms and Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men in the Fall; who have ſought out many Inventions, through which comes blindneſs, hardneſs of heart, and unbelief; from whence proceeds envying, hatred, malice, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, and all other evils whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever: He who is Prince of Darkneſs, having his Power and Authority there in blindneſs and darkneſs, carries the Creature into bondage at his will, he being ruler in the Children of diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: But glory and praiſes be to the Lord our God, who is the great God, and beſides him there is none: It's he alone that opens the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings of them that fear him; who hath diſcovered unto us, the Miſtery of the workings of Satan, and the bredth and length of his rule and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, and the end thereof; for ever
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:44321:141"/>is he who thus opens unto them that fear him, greatly to be admired by all his Sons and Daughters, who are redeemed by his great power out of <hi>Adam</hi> in the Fall, up into him that never fell, through whom we have acceſs into his preſence, the which ſweetens all to us, and carries all that truly truſt in him through all Tempeſts and Storms whatſoever: Even by his Arm and Power, who will and can appeaſe and lay all Tempeſts and Storms when they have accompliſhed that for which they were ſuffered to be raiſed, he being ſeen and known who walkes upon a troubled Sea; as in dayes paſt, ſo yeſterday, and to day, and for ever. So Dear Friends, keep out his appearance, who would work queſtionings and reaſonings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Rod of the wicked, with which the Righteous are threatned: (It's for the Fire) (It's for the Fire) that's Gods Word: So all to abide faithful in his power, by whom all appearances of the wicked one may be reſiſted in his many wills, who is
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:44321:142"/>a Murderer and a Thief; who walkes about in the Earthly mind, compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing there, and betraying there; and draws back into the Earth there: And then when tryals come, the Earth is in the way; and then the falſe ballance is ſet up in the heart, and the precious Jewel being weighed therein, the Earth that appears heavieſt, and ſo carries the ſway in the mind, and ſo comes to be ſet up in the heart: So thereby many come to loſe the everlaſting reward of peace, and joy, and comfort, which is in that Life which lives and abides for ever: So Dear Friends, have an Eye to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of well doing; even that Pearl of great Price, and let it have domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in the heart, and the Earth ſet under all; that ſo we may continue to the end in all well-doing; and patient and meek running in that race which is ſet before us, unto whom belongs the Crown of Immortal Life. When the Lord pleaſes to ſhew me a clear way unto you, I ſhall be willing to ſee your Faces, to the end that we
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:44321:142"/>may be refreſht together; even from that everlaſting Fountain, from whence comes all our freſh ſprings which glads the Souls of the upright for ever: But at preſent I find my Teſtimony re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, where I have had the greateſt time of my Converſation in the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant of Truth, Light and Life.</p>
            <p>That wicked ruler who rules in the Children of diſobedience, hath many Agents here abouts, as well as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther places, who have been at work amongſt us: They took from me ſix Cows, for a Fine of 20 <hi>l.</hi> for ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the things of God according to his will, (but they had great trouble with them:) From my Brother <hi>John</hi> nine Cowes, for a Silent Meeting at his houſe; and from another all his Beds, Cloaths, two Geldings, Pewter, Braſs, Leather, and abundance of other things, to the value, as is ſuppoſed, of near 50 <hi>l.</hi> for a Silent Meeting at his Houſe: At <hi>Kingſton</hi> on <hi>Thames,</hi> Friends have had abundance taken from them, and they kept out of their Meeting
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:44321:143"/>place, and not ſuffered to ſtand quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Streets; but ſome were taken and ſent to Priſon, and others drove about by Souldiers in a barbarous manner; and ſeveral other Fines have been levyed, too long to mention: And Meetings being diſturbed, Friends being haled out, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which works for good to them that truly fear and obey the voice of the Living God: The more they ſtrive, the more doth Power and Life appear; which keeps Friends Clear, Sweet and Innocent; even to love God above all, and their Neighbours as themſelves, greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring that they may ſee a neceſſity of building upon the ſame Rock; even Chriſt Jeſus, who is the power of God, and wiſdom of God, who feeds all that truly hunger with ſpiritual Meat, and all them that truly thirſt with ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Drink; him who was glorified with the Father in the beginning, by whom all things were made, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues the ſame yeſterday, to day, and for ever: Through whom Friends Meetings in theſe parts are freſh, lively
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:44321:143"/>and conſtant: But the great Boaſters, as <hi>Presbyterians, Independants</hi> and <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,</hi> who have kicked againſt the Everlaſting Covenant of Late in their own hearts, yet in their Imaginations have ſaid they would follow Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But they now, as in days paſt, when the ſtorm was up, are drove into their holes: But they would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it in days paſt, before the ſtorm was ſeen, when it was teſtified unto them: But they are Foxes, they can cover themſelves no more; if they turn not to the Truth now, they ſtand in danger of being ſwallowed up in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for ever.</p>
            <p>So Dear Friends, that which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us, is to be thankful, and to meet often together, that ſo we may grow up together, even from one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to another of an Heavenly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearnce of him in whom is all glory; that ſo we may bear his Heavenly Image for ever.

            <p>So now as one high flown in Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, undertakes to make a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant for others: But the better to colour over and uſher in his <hi>Babel,</hi> he takes many of the true Prophets words, and therewith decks himſelf over, that he may appear the more beautiful in the ſight of his good Maſters.

Oh bleſſed Jeſus, I come to thee hungry and hardly beſtead, poor, and wretched, and miſerable, and blind, and naked; a moſt loathſom poluted Wretch, a guilty condemned Malefactor, unworthy for ever to waſh the Feet of the Servants of my Lord, much more to be married to the King of Glory: But ſuch is thine unparalleled love, I do here with all my power accept thee, and take thee for my Head and Husband.</hi> Did you ever hear of a more Loathſom, Impudent Harlot, who in all her filthineſs and abominations, preſumes to ſay that God is her Husband: Oh high pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:44321:146"/>which ariſes from the nature of the Devil; this is made indeed in the Earthly wiſdom, and there ratified, the which I leave all you to judge who do return in ſome degree or meaſure the Divine, Pure, Holy nature of the Son of Righteouſneſs, into which all do grow; and ſo take a view of the Heavenly Marriage of the Heavenly man, and compare it with that loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome conceited marriage, <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. <hi>Let us be glad and rejoyce, and give honour to him for the Marriage of the Lamb is come, and his Wife hath made her ſelf ready: And to her was granted, that ſhe ſhould be arrayed in fine Linnen, clean and White; for the Linnen is the Righteouſneſs of Saints,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Alleluja,</hi> for the Lord God Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent reigneth; here is a Heavenly melody: Had the Author of that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per been ſo Ingenious to have come to that Marriage Supper, he might have partaken of the Heavenly joy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and not have been left to that great confuſion manifeſted in that Paper: For the Invitation unto it hath
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:44321:147"/>gone throughout the Nation, that they that would come, might come, for the Fountain to waſh and prepare for it, hath been and is open, glory to God for ever. But further, ſee the confuſion of the Author of that Paper in theſe words: <hi>And the Covenant which I have ratified on Earth, let it be ratified in Heaven:</hi> What, after the Marriag is concluded, to be made? What work is this? he hath ratified it on Earth, and would have it done ſo in Heaven? but whether he will or no, it ſeems he doth not know; ſo all is left in doubt and fear again: What a ſad bargain you have made all this while; who ſpent your Money and time after ſuch Idle Immaginary do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
            <p>Now all you who have ſeen and read the Authors ſuppoſed Covenant, be ſo Ingenious to read how God was pleaſed to give forth his Law and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, the which he ratified in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and compare them with the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors pretended Covenant which he ratified on Earth, without any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:44321:147"/>of the parties conſent, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to be concerned; let any prove the contrary if they can, and let him ſhew if he can in all the Scriptures of Truth, where God ever left it to vain man to make a Covenant to be bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to all others in that manner, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That many did vow obedience, and were incouraged in the Covenant of the Lord, that is true and manifeſt through the Teſtimonies of the Prophets; but where did any preſume to bind God in that manner? Oh groſs Idolatry; But the bleſſed holy God at all times and ſeaſons, according to his bleſſed plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and good will to mankind, did give forth his Law and Commands, and ſo Covenanted to be the God of his people, to keep them in Peace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> On condition of their living in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his will and pleaſure mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in his time and ſeaſon, as you may read, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. and <hi>Exod.</hi> 19. <hi>The Lord our God made a Covenant with us in</hi> Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reb: <hi>The Lord talked with them face to face in the Mount, in the midſt of the fire; which cauſed a fear and trembling:
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:44321:148"/>Theſe words the Lord ſpake unto all your Aſſembly,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and he wrote them in two tables of ſtone:</hi> Wherein the Lord ſhewed his glory and greatneſs; and they ſaid, <hi>we have ſeen this day that God doth talk with man, and he liveth: So the Law was added becauſe of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions till the Seed ſhould come,</hi> Gal. 3.19. <hi>So Chriſt is the end of the Law for Righteouſneſs for every one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth,</hi> Rom. 10.3. But concerning the firſt Covenant which God made with his people when he ſhewed fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and love; <hi>In taking them by the hand to lead them out of</hi> Egypt, Heb. 8. <hi>Becauſe they continued not in my Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, I regarded them not, ſaith the Lord:</hi> But now mark that ſecond Covenant which is without fault: <hi>After thoſe dayes, ſaith the Lord, I will put my Laws into their mind, and write them in their hearts; and I will be to them a God, and they ſhall be to me a People: And they ſhall not teach every man his Neighbour, and every man his Brother, ſaying, know the Lord; for all ſhall know me from the leaſt to the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:44321:148"/>greatest: For I will be merciful to their unrighteouſneſs, and their ſins and their iniquities will I remember no more:</hi> Oh for ever bleſſed is this Covenant, there is no fault in it; and that it is a bad nature indeed by which Imaginary Covenants are made, which hath a tendency of drawing peoples minds out from waiting to know this bleſſed Covenant in the mind and heart: So to the ſober and wiſe in heart I write, that they may weigh theſe weighty things in a true ballance, and from thence give forth true judgment.</p>
            <p>And mind further the Authors words: <hi>This Covenant you are adviſed to make not only in heart, but in word, not only in word, but in writing:</hi> Sure he thinks all's done; but if that muſt be made or written in the heart, then there will be no room for Gods Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, for that doth not at all agree with that confuſed ſtuff; and what pity it is that any ſhould be deprived of Gods righteous Covenant, ſince Gods love is univerſally tendered therein, and inviteth all unto it, that
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:44321:149"/>they may partake of its pure, holy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to convert ſinners, and make wiſe ſimple and Ignorant people, who are ready to periſh for want of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; the which is communicated to them that fear God, and wait to feel his bleſſed promiſe to extend his mercy and goodneſs therein, to overcome and give victory over that which is evil and corrupt: But further he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeth; <hi>To ſpread the writing before the Lord, as if you would preſent it to him as your act and deed:</hi> So here is an act and no act, ſometimes preſumed to be done and ratified, then again in doubtful terms; as if you would do ſo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſaith the Author, <hi>when you have done this, ſet your hand to it. Anſwer,</hi> ſo you may ſtand to it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, whilſt he that exhorts you runs away, Fox-like, creeping into his hole, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> why is not his hand to it. Note further, <hi>Keep it,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>as a memorial of the ſolemn tranſactions that have paſsed between God and you. Anſwer,</hi> Since God here is made party concerned; you that concern your
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:44321:149"/>ſelves therein, had need know when and how God appeared unto you; ſure elſe (if you be not wilfully blind) you will ſee all that ſtuff to be meer Imaginations, if you cannot ſee them to be Deviliſh Inventions, the which indeed they are; Now take this laſt advice in theſe words: That you may have recourſe unto it in Doubts and Temptations; what think you now, either the Paper muſt be an Idol, or Chriſt? It is not Chriſt, therefore it muſt be an Idol, then the Author muſt be an Idolater; let them that concern themſelves with it deny it if they can: Hath not this a tendency of making void the love God through Chriſt Jeſus, who is the way to God out of doubt, and through his power and wiſdom all doubts are reſolved; who alſo is the ſuccourer of them that are tempted, and the deliverer of them who are guided by him out of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; into his holy Name all are to be Baptized, Dipped, Plunged, that Sin and Iniquity may be brought under, and conſumed by Fire and his holy Spirit;
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:44321:150"/>which is the one true Baptiſm, through and by him who is to increaſe in all his Bleſſed Office as Prieſt to Miniſter according to the neceſſities of all that come unto him, as proper to open the Myſteries that are hid from the Wiſe and Prudent; a Biſhop to overſee what is lacking in the Church, a Shepherd to lead his Flock in an out, and to Feed them in Green Paſtures of Life and Peace, a Phyſitian to heal the Wounded, a Prince to give forth his Righteous Laws and Decrees in his Church; where his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, Holy Laws are written in the Heart, is to be read and ſpread before all, that all who are met in his holy Name, may partake of his Divine Nature, and ſo become Heirs of his everlaſting Kingdom, which never ſhall have end: So Bleſſed are they who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in God, and do not make haſte, but wait patiently for the fulfilling of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; that you may be delivered and kept from Worſhipping the Inventions of men: So in good will to all who have a deſire to Truth is this given forth by.</p>

<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.11, 12.</note> for I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther received it of man, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was I taught it, but by the revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> ſo that the bleſſed Goſpel is an inward glorious work, wrought by the Spirit and power of Chriſt Jeſus, the foundation of all the Prophets and Apoſtles; on which the true believers were and are built, to the praiſe and honour of God for ever.</p>
            <p>And whereas he ſaith, <hi>the grace of the Covenant unfolded;</hi> therein he ſhows what birth he is of, which
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:44321:152"/>might fitter be imployed in its Poetry, in making of Balads, then to be found ſo preſumptuous in affirming the grace of the Covenant unfolded in that dark (imaginary ſtuff in that Paper.)</p>
            <p>The grace of God being an invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible appearance of Gods holy Spirit unto all mankind, which is teſtified to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Titus: For the grace of God that bringeth Salvation, hath appeared to all men, (Teaching us,</hi> &amp;c.) So here was and is the univerſal love of God to all mankind; not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all might know the Truth and be ſaved: So in that the grace of God appears unto all, the renders of his love is therein ſhewed to all without reſpect of perſons: That in every Nation they that fear God and work righteouſneſs through the bleſſed operation of the grace of his holy Spirit, ſuch are accepted of him: So than they are in the way of a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, who believe in God, and wait in a full aſſurance: And truſt in him, for the knowledge of the infallible teachings of grace, whereby way is
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:44321:152"/>miniſtred unto a growth in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Chriſt Jeſus: And thus far the Apoſtle did unfold the love of God, from what he had handled, felt ſeen, of the mercies and riches of Gods great love to all mankind therein, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a true witneſs of the love of God through the grace of his holy Spirit; by and in which the good of all was and is ſought, but indeed there be but few that doth regard it, though his hand of love be ſtretcht out all the day long: There be ſo many falſe Teachers, who by good Words and fair Speeches deceives poor ſimple ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant people, through their great flouriſhing words about the grace of God; out of the ſenſible feeling of its bleſſed vertue and power in its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Teachings and thereby bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Salvation: And though this love of God hath appeared to all, all have not the knowledge thereof, as they had and have, who are true believers in God: As ſaid the Apoſtle to <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> Teaching us, ſo true believers
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:44321:153"/>Baptized by one bleſſed Spirit into one body; and therein being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into Gods holy Covenant of grace, cannot but cry out; Oh the vertue of Chriſt Jeſus by whom comes grace and truth, which is of a healing nature, glad tydings indeed unto wounded Souls, and none can be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther truly ſenſible of the unfolding of this love of God, to the refreſhing and comforting of their immortal Souls, but by the feeling of its vertue and power, to quicken, revive and raiſe up out of ſin and iniquity the cauſe of death.</p>
            <p>And in his Poetry he ſaith; <hi>Gods works preach not redemption from Hell, the name of Chriſt there is not legible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> And in and by all Gods power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and glorious works; both within man and without, is the bleſſed and powerful name of Chriſt to be read and underſtood: So its Gods works alone that preach redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the power of Hell and death,
<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19.</note> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is Chriſts holy name legible: But
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:44321:153"/>as it is written, <hi>that which is born of fleſh is fleſh,</hi> and ſo a heap of fleſhly works are in that Paper, to the ſhame of the Author, in giving them that Title, <hi>&amp;c. And as that which is born of fleſh is fleſh, ſo that which is born of the ſpirit is ſpirit;</hi> and theſe two births are contrary, for the birth of the fleſh, though it may ſpeak great ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling words, and tell of the victory of Chriſt, and triumph in ſwelling words of his fame, as in that Paper; yet it being a worker of iniquity, it muſt have that Sentence, <hi>depart from me;</hi> it can in no wiſe inherit the Kingdom of God, though it may glory and ſay, I have preached and done many things, yet its product is but ſpiritual wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs got in a high place, which the indignation of the Lord is againſt, ſo it muſt be caſt out; he that can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it let him.</p>
            <p>And thus much might be ſaid as to the words in that Paper; but to all Impartial readers this is ſufficient, to convince them that that Paper is none of the Goſpels glory, nor none of the
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:44321:154"/>Covenant of grace, neither is the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace at all there unfolded? But it is a meer parcel of conceivings from the ſame imaginary ſpirit, that uſes to be Imployed about making of Ballads.</p>
            <p>And ſo in true love to all unto whom this may come, I counſel you to mind the fear of offending God, that you may be made ſenſible of the bleſſed appearance of the grace of Gods holy Spirit, that you may be received into the bleſſed Covenant thereof, and therein be witneſs of its ſufficiency, in teaching what to deny, and what to do, this being the means ordained of God for the good of all, and all that becomes ſenſible of the infallible teachings of the grace of God; ſuch will not wonder at Silent Meetings, as many do who are out of the ſenſe of Gods love therein; many ſuch grow deſpiſers, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and cannot believe the effectual works of the grace of Gods holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, though in the demonſtration and power thereof, they be declared and
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:44321:154"/>publiſhed from time to time: And I wiſh all to take heed of being exalted through vain glory in fleſhly works, the which are attended with ſorrow and miſery, and will bring all them that reſt there to the end, but in the Lord is everlaſting glory. And mind the ſaying of the Apoſtle to the <hi>Epheſians; But God who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us; even when we were dead in ſins, hath he quickned us together with Chriſt, by grace yea are ſaved;</hi> So mind the bleſſed teachings of the grace of God which is pure, holy and perfect in every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and this the mark which all ſhould ſet before them as they expect to run well in their Heavenly race, and obtain the bleſſed peace of God to their Souls, which is the will of God; and in the knowledge thereof I give this Teſtimony, who am what I am by Cods Grace, and therein a well wiſher to all who are truly ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the knowledge of Cod, in which love I reſt,</p>

<pb n="287" facs="tcp:44321:157"/>ſhine in darkneſs, yet darkneſs can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not comprehend it; and Chriſt knew what he ſaid, when he ſaid, <hi>I am the Light of the World,</hi> though the World through malice, envy and prejudice are ſo corrupted and darkened, that he is become unto them a ſtumbling ſtone and a rock of offence, yet he is the Light of the World, and doth light the Candle of the wicked: but when the wicked are lighted, and their wickedneſs manifeſt, they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten hate Light that makes manifeſt their wickedneſs, and puts out the Candle, and ſo adds ſin to ſin in get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting covers to hide their tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And to ſuch the hands of the Lord is ſtretched out in the love and mercy to them, but all gain-ſayers of it do turn into vanity, calling good evil, and evil good, light darkneſs, and darkneſs they call light, and herein they reject love and mercy, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace hatred, and lay other founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which the Lord hath not laid, and ſo labour in vain, and build in vain, which are all for the fire, and
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:44321:158"/>muſt be deſtroyed, the mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it. Oh that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would conſider and be wiſe, and not go on to provoke the Lord to ſhut them out into utter darkneſs; for out of darkneſs people are invited to turn to the Light, and from Satans power unto God, that they may have a ſenſe and knowledge of his love and mercy, who gives remiſſion of ſins to them who truly and unfeignedly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of them, and forſake them, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving themſelves before him in ſo doing, and imbraceth that love and mercy and good will therein, and ſo watching and walking in his light there will be more light and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding given of his way, truth and life, the which he is making known in the Earth and his Salvation among his people.</p>
            <p>Therefore be admoniſhed not to provoke him, and harden your hearts againſt his reproofs, for in ſo doing you will be more and more confounded, and your bonds of corruption in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will be made ſtronger, and when
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:44321:158"/>his good Spirit hath done ſtriving, and the light and councel thereof be taken from you, then will you be left in utter darkneſs where is weeping and gnaſhing of Teeth: For of a Truth the Lord is riſen in great power to break down all the pleaſant pictures and likeneſſes which mankind in their corrupt wills and affection have made of Religions and Worſhips, and through their dark immaginary works therein, they have oppoſed the Lords making known the true Religion and the true Worſhip which Chriſt did and doth ſet up in his Spirit of Truth, and is ſtanding and remains firm and unchangeable.</p>
            <p>And therefore in the bowels of love I admoniſh all you who are not come to a true ſenſe and experience of the Lords good will and pleaſure in making known his way, Truth and Life, but are in ſome tenderneſs in panting after the Lord for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his good will and pleaſure therein: I deſire you to be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to conſider whether you have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:44321:159"/>in the Light that comes from him, and leads to him; and if you were true believers in God and in his Chriſt, then you cannot deny the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of love and light that comes from him; for what is known of God is manifeſt in us, he ſhews it unto: Oh its a good thing to wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lord in Truth, with a ſingle eye unto him who ſits with light and underſtanding of his bleſſed way, Truth and Life, Chriſt that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Abraham,</hi> and was in the body which was prepared for him to do the will of his Father, in which he ſuffered without the Gates of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> by wicked hands, and roſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and ſhewed himſelf unto many hundreds of witneſſes, and hath many thouſand witneſſes this day of his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and reſurrection; who is the ſame yeſterday, to day, and forever; a miſtery which is hid from the worldly wiſe and prudent, who live in an exaltation above the pure, holy manifeſtation of the Light of Gods holy Spirit; and ſo neglecting the
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:44321:159"/>one thing neceſſary, do live in the many things where offence to the juſt is given dayly, and the movings of Gods good Spirit is grieved and quenched; and then comparing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with themſelves, and meaſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves by themſelves, they are not wiſe in heart; and therefore are they ſhut out from the knowledge of the way of Truth and Life.</p>
            <p>Therefore I do perſwade all to wait low at wiſdoms gate for the opening thereof, that your hearts may be ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with grace; and then that which hath been of low degree, as to the eſteem mankind hath had of it, by the ſavour of Gods grace, it will be beloved and eſteemed, and exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and thoſe dark immaginary works which hath been lets and hindrances of the knowledge of the Truth, Way, and Life; they will be hated and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſteemed: And things will be put in order by the true wiſdom, to the praiſe and honour of God, and to the great peace and comfort of all the truly humble in heart: And thus in

               <p>THeſe are the works of the power of Darkneſs, to render the Light of Chriſt Jeſus of it ſelf inſufficient to lead into Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity; wherein the Author of the Book hath ſufficiently manifeſted his folly, in undertaking to detect that for Error, which is a fundamental Truth.</p>
               <p>Indeed he hath made a bold at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt in his dark comprehenſion, in going about to limit the leading of the Light of Chriſt Jeſus, which
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:44321:162"/>ſhews plainly that he is not acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the way thereof; and in adventuring to ſpeak and to affirm things ſo confidently, that he hath no knowledge of; this beſpeaks him to be a raſh inconſiderate man: But leaſt we ſhould know him, (like a Coward) he hath concealed his Name. And in our reaſonable and faithful confidence in Chriſt, the Way, Truth and Life, we cannot give ſuch dark ignorant works better enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment then they deſerve; and by giving of them their due entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment according to Truth, we have cauſe to believe the endeavors of ſuch dark immaginary Spirits will grow weaker and weaker, and the turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of things upſide down (as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of that Book and his Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath done) will prove a miſerable hard travel and labour, that will end in great ſorrow and trouble.</p>
               <p>But to come to the buſineſs in as brief manner as may be, that I may not be tedious to the unprejudiced Reader: This ſhort anſwer is recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended,
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:44321:162"/>ſhewing the drift of that dark Spirit; by anſwering only ſome particulars: Such manner of work as this having been often anſwered by many worthy Servants of the Lord, the which are faithful witneſſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all ſuch dark works.</p>
               <p>By the way let it be remembred. 1. That we truly own the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and all true and effectual out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Teaching in their place, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the holy Spirit. 2. That by the aſſiſtance of the ſame Spirit only, the Scriptures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are truly to be underſtood and be made profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table. 3. This Spirit works imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly in the underſtanding, where ever outward means becomes ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectul. 4. Divine Light and Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being all ſufficient to teach imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly, it is not to be limited to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward means.</p>
               <p>Firſt, to prove the ſufficiency of the Light of Chriſt Jeſus to lead into true Chriſtianity, either without out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward teaching, or by it: The Lord God of Heaven and Earth be his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:44321:163"/>and powerful outgoings in the Light, being not to be limited; take two or three inſtances out of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets concerning this bleſſed leader, the Light of Chriſt within, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 97.11. <hi>Light is ſown for the righteous and gladneſs for the upright in heart;</hi> and ſaid <hi>David, rejoyce in the Lord ye righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and give thanks at the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his holineſs:</hi> The which many thouſands do this day, (by the ſpringing up of this ever bleſſed Light within) even where outward Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not; and by the effectual work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in its powerful operation in ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up out of darkneſs, many who had the name of that they were not, were both convinced and converted and led into true Chriſtianity: And <hi>Iſaiah</hi> propheſying the coming of Chriſts kingdom, ſaith <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.5. <hi>O houſe of</hi> Jacob, <hi>come ye, and let us walk in the light of the Lord;</hi> and in the 55 chap. 4 v. <hi>Behold I have given him for a witneſs to the people, a leader and commander to the people:</hi> And of this Covenant, this light promiſed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:44321:163"/>the Gentiles: <hi>John</hi> the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Prophet that was born of a woman, God ſent to be a witneſs that all through him might believe, and this Teſtimony of the true light that ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teneth every man that comes into the World, he had from God who ſent him, and not man's Teaching: And <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.12. ſpeaking of the Goſpel: <hi>For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it; but by the Revelation of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> So here men were made Chriſtians by Chriſt the Light of the World, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out outward Teaching, and this over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throws the affirmation of the Author of that Book, who ſaith, <hi>That men do not become Chriſtians by following the Light within, without outward Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> But the Author may know that theſe men true Chriſtians, and men. But I do affirm that there was never a true Chriſtian made by mens Teaching, without the leading and guiding of the Light of Chriſts Spirit within; and that is by the leading of Chriſt within, that people are made
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:44321:164"/>true Chriſtians, and the gainſaying of the Truth is the cauſe there are ſo many falſe Chriſtians now adays, by reaſon of ſuch natural men as the Author of that Book manifeſts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be, being ignorant of the Light, not knowing the way thereof; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth he know the fundamental principle of the people called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> the which is a manifeſt token of the groſs darkneſs that he is under, in that he preſumes to call that error which he is a ſtranger to: But neither he nor any elſe hath yet proved our oppoſing the leading and guiding of the Light of Chriſt within, to its leadings and guidings in Teaching without: But we do oppoſe its bleſſed Leading within and Teaching with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, to ſuch dark unchriſtian-like Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits that doth not know the way thereof; who in ſuch like dark works in a high degree of pride and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy, are going about to limit and ſet bounds to the works of the Lord God Almighty.</p>
               <pb n="301" facs="tcp:44321:164"/>
               <p>So that which he calls a fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Error, is a fundamental Truth; that it is poſſible with God this day and time, as well as in days paſt, to lead by the Son of his love into true Chriſtianity (with (or without) out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Teaching) of which Truth the Lord God hath raiſed abundance of living witneſſes this day, and by his arm and power he is raiſing up more dayly, who are built upon the ſame foundation that the Prophets, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and the Primitive Chriſtians were built upon, againſt which work and foundation the gates of Hell can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prevail.</p>
               <p>This Covenant, this Light, this Witneſs, this bleſſed Leader, (Gods love, Gods gift to the people) all mind that it did not only inſpire im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly the Apoſtles, but alſo the people; by which Inſpiration people come to underſtand when they have done evil, even when none without can accuſe them; by this love wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed people are made ſenſible of their wickedneſs, <hi>though indeed,</hi> as it is
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:44321:165"/>written, <hi>the Candle of the wicked is often put out;</hi> yet many times they are overcome with the Light and Love of God therein, that thereby they forſake their evil (and turn from their wickedneſs;) and by yielding their members ſervants unto this righteous appearance of the grace of God, and by obeying the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible teaching thereof, many have been converted into the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians faith; and by the Truth ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and then juſtified through their obedience to the Heavenly gift of God are made true and living Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, abiding the Baptiſm of Chriſt, who Baptizeth with Fire and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt; and therein are confirmed and ſettled under the ſhadow of his wing, whoſe fruit is very precious and pleaſant: And it is by this Light that the voice of the true Shepherd comes to be known from the falſe Shepherd; thus by grubbing up the root of the tree, the branches muſt needs fall with it.</p>
               <pb n="303" facs="tcp:44321:165"/>
               <p>Page 4. He proceeds thus, <hi>viz. You know it was ſaid by our bleſſed Saviour, that ſtrait is the gate and narrow is the way that leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it: And I little doubt but that an appearance at firſt of a greater ſtrictneſs and narrowneſs in your way, then in theirs that differs from you; was a temptation to ſome injudicious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> If we were not in the ſame ſtrait and narrow way that Chriſt did ſpeak of, where we are partakers of Gods great love in that reſt and peace which he hath prepared for them that believe, fear and love him, it were an eaſie matter to go back again into the broad way; there be opportunities enough given beſides this great one given by this Author of that Book in his groſs abominable Inſinuations: But ſuch is the manner of ſuch dark Spirits, to pretend great love to the Souls of others, and are not in a capacity to pity and love their own.</p>
               <p>But he ſaith, <hi>That might have been eſcaped had we conſidered that the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

But I perceive this is his great trouble as it was <hi>Hamans, Mordicai</hi> would not bow to him; we not going out of the faith of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt into the reſpect of perſons, but faithfully keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his commands, and abiding in his Doctrine; the which is true whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he wickedly ſuggeſts to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: This he accounts Incivilities and a piece of Superſtition of our own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing; and that ſeveral orders among the <hi>Papiſts</hi> have been built upon the ſame bottom; (but mind) all this while his name is concealed, ſhewing that he is not willing others ſhould know what bottom he is built upon; but who that are wiſe can expect any better fruit of ſuch a corrupt tree that grows up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the root of Imaginations? he hath nothing elſe for his bottom of all that he hath ſaid.</p>

               <p>And he goes on in page 6, 7. in theſe words: <hi>Ye have taken liberty to walk looſly and caſt off this yoak, and that is in not governing your ſpirits, paſſions and tongues according to the Laws of his Kingdom,</hi> &amp;c. And this he infers from ſome words he hath taken out of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Burroughs</hi>'s Book, <hi>as thou curſed, thou beaſt to whom the Plagues of God are due, a reprobate, a Child of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thou art thou diſobedient one,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> By this it is manifeſt, that if that Author had been in the falſe Prophets dayes, he would have been as much offended with the true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets for calling the falſe Prophets <hi>greedy dogs, and dumb dogs,</hi> and many ſuch like words; and as <hi>David</hi> ſaid <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.12. <hi>Man being in honour abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not, he is like the beaſts that periſh;</hi> or if he had been in that day of Chriſt, who indeed was very humble and meek, but in his reproofs of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie he was very ſharp, as appears in theſe words, <hi>Wo to you Hypocrites,</hi> likening them to whited Walls, pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Sepulchres; and he ſaid to them

               <p>And he ſaith, (ſpeaking of Chriſt,) <hi>he hath ſtrictly injoyned his followers to

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> But all this while this man that doth thus preſcribe from what is written, what others ſhould do, he himſelf doth not ſo; it appears by concealing of his name, he is not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be known; But ſure when he bethinks himſelf, he cannot ſuppoſe that the ſpirit of Truth doth lead its followers to eſteem Hypocrites, and thoſe that oppoſe the way thereof (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove them that are led and guided by it.)</p>
               <p>And ſure the Author by diſeſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Light of Chriſt, that ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teneth every man that comes into the World, rendering it a natural Light, as he hath done in many places, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come very blind indeed; if he thinks the Spirit of Truth did forbid the judgment of Truth: by theſe words of Chriſt <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. <hi>Judge not, that ye be not judged,</hi> this he ſpoke to Hypocrites that went about to pull out a mote out of others eyes, and the beam remained

<pb n="309" facs="tcp:44321:168"/>as the Prophets, Chriſt and his Apoſtles did; though in very ſharp reproofs to gainſayers, is not againſt true humility, nor a ſpeaking evil of any man.</p>
               <p>In Page. 11. The Author ſaith, <hi>Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you are not guilty of rejecting Gods way and method of converting men to, and keeping them in the way of ſaving Faith, Repentance and Evangelical obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; and of inventing and chuſing one of your own,</hi> &amp;c. Which method he inſtances out of two Authors, <hi>Edward Burroughs</hi>'s Book, and one of <hi>William Pens.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The which is as followeth word for word.</p>
               <p>In the works of <hi>Edward Burrough,</hi> who you are pleaſed to ſtile that true Prophet in the Title page, which are publiſhed by you; there are theſe ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: In page 252, thus, <hi>His pure Spirit is put into the inward parts, to be the rule and guide of life in all things:</hi> And again, <hi>Only by the teaching of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Spirit, is the living God known in the Creature.</hi> Again page 408. <hi>It is promiſed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that the Spirit ſhall
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:44321:169"/>lead into all Truth, and ſuch do own the Scriptures, but not as their Teacher; for the anointing dwells in them, and they need no man to teach them, but as that anointing teacheth all things; for all the Children of God are taught of God, and need not any other Teacher, nor need to ſay one to another, know the Lord; and all ſuch own the Scriptures to be the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of that which they believe and have received:</hi> And again in page 834. <hi>The only perfect rule of Conſcience in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe to God is the Spirit of Chriſt, and not any other thing: And becauſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beſides the Spirit of God exerciſes the Conſcience; therefore it is that there are ſo many wayes and Sects of Religion and kinds of Worſhip in Chriſtendom and among Chriſtians, while the Spirit of Chriſt only is not the rule of Judgment and exerciſe of Conſcience to God and man:</hi> Again page 861. <hi>The judgment in that matter (Hereſie) muſt be juſt, equal, holy, and (only) by the Spirit of Chriſt which is infallible, and gives in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of Judgement and diſcerning into all caſes and things.</hi>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Pen</hi> ſpends the fourth Chapter of his late Book; Intituled, <hi>Reaſon against Railing,</hi> to prove that the Light within, and not the Scriptures is the rule of Faith and practice, In page. 47. he ſaith, <hi>We dare boldly affirm in the name of the Lord, that the great reaſon of our belief concerning them, the Scriptures is not any outward thing; but inward Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony recorded, and Heavenly Amen, that we have received from the holy Light within us, to the Truth and faithfulneſs of thoſe ſayings.</hi> Again p. 48. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Scriptures are ſo far from being the great rule of faith and practice; that the Light of Chriſt within us, is both our warrant and rule for faith and obedience to them.</hi> Again page 114. <hi>Let it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that Chriſt promiſed to ſend the ſpirit of Truth to lead into all Truth; as much as to ſay, none are led into the Truth, nor in the Truth, but by the holy Spirit of Truth; or that their practice is a lye, or they are led into a lye, who are not led by the Spirit of Truth, that alone leads into all the ways of Truth; where by Truth is not meant the meer
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:44321:170"/>Letter of the Scripture, which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is true: But the living power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Truth, Chriſt the Way, the Truth and the Life; of which the Scripture is but a record or declaration.</hi> And page 115. <hi>Many may run into the practice of ſeveral outward things mentioned in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to have been the practice of Saints in former Ages, and yet not be led into the Truth; for all that is but Will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, imitation and unwarrantable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now let all the wiſe in heart, who do retain ſo much of ſenſe of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Truths leading and operation thereof in them, as that thereby they are in ſome degree in a capacity to judge of ſpiritual matters, and that have a deſire that God may not take away his holy Spirit from them: I ſay, let all ſuch in the coole of the day, when all ſelf Intereſt is laid aſide, judge whether theſe men, <hi>Edward Burroughs</hi> and <hi>William Pen,</hi> and all them who are of the ſame Faith and Judgment with them, do deſerve ſuch ſtrange contradicton as the Author of that Book hath raiſed and made againſt them.</p>
               <pb n="313" facs="tcp:44321:170"/>
               <p>To be ſure their method (as he calls it) is clearly agreeing with Chriſt and his Apoſtles: Chriſt Jeſus the Light of the World, the Way, Truth and Life, did direct his followers to take heed to the Spirit of Truth that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth the World of ſin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and he counſelled them to take that for their guide into all Truth: And ought not all Chriſtians to be followers of Chriſt their Lord and Maſter; and how is it poſſible that any ſhould follow Chriſt, except they be led by the Spirit of Truth in themſelves? And he that ſteals away their minds from that guide, he is a Thief; and as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>The Thief comes to ſteal, to Murder and to destroy; but I am come that you may have Life, and that you may have it more abundantly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> is very open and plain in his Teſtimony concerning this matter, in theſe words, <hi>The things of God knows no man, but the Spirit of God; by this the deep things of God are ſearched out:</hi> And are there not many deep things of God contained in
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:44321:171"/>Scriptures? The which is not poſſible to be underſtood and ſearcht out by any other Spirit, but only and alone by the Spirit of Truth; therefore this muſt needs be a ſufficient teacher of mankind without the Scripture, as it was to <hi>Abel, Enoch,</hi> and to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the holy men of God long before there was any of the old or new Teſtament written.</p>
               <p>And it was the great love of God in the moving of his holy Spirit in thoſe faithful Servants, by whom thoſe weighty things as are recorded in the Scriptures of Truth were given forth: And it is the great love of God in the moving of his holy Spirit in its leadings and teaching of his people, through which the many Types, Figures, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies, and many hard ſayings comes to be underſtood, and a clear diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing comes to be known between the Jew outward and the Jew inward, between the Law outward and the Law of the Spirit of Truth inward, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſhadow of good things, and the good things themſelves; and alſo
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:44321:171"/>between the Spirit and the Letter, the Power and the Form, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for want of fearing God, and taking heed to the motions of his bleſſed Spirit of Truth; that is the cauſe there are ſo many heaps of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions about the Scripture; therefore it is that all learned men in the Spirit of Truth do ſo highly eſteem the teachings thereof, as abſolutely neceſſary to life and peace: And all whoſe minds are converted by the Spirit of Truth, and are ſpiritually exerciſed therein, and feeling the life and peace that flows from it unto their Souls; this confirms them, ſettles them, and makes them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable and unchangeable in their Faith in the power of the Lord, who hath been thus merciful in opening this fountain of life and love, where a waſhing and cleanſing comes to be wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed, and entrance miniſtered into the kingdom of God, and of this day that is breaking forth and ſhining clearer and clearer: <hi>Edward Burroughs</hi> that man of God, was a faithful Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the hand of the Lord, and his
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:44321:172"/>works do demonſtrate the ſame to thraſh and cut down hypocriſie and gainſayers of the Truth and faithfulneſs of God unto mankind: And in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of this bleſſed work and ſervice in the everlaſting and unchangeable Truth, the Lord hath raiſed up <hi>William Pen</hi> with a Teſtimony: And in his continuance therein unto the end of his days he will receive the ſame Crown of Immortal Life; and their Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies which the Author calls their method taken out of their Books is faithful and true, and doth and will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſo to all that are in the leaſt lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Spirit of Truth.</p>
               <p>But in contradiction of thoſe faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and true Teſtimonies of <hi>Edward Burrough</hi>'s and <hi>William Pen</hi>'s, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of that Book undertakes to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe a method and way, the which he calls Gods method and way; this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a long ramble too tedious to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, I ſhall draw up the ſcope and tendency thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That</hi> (Page 15.) <hi>after Chriſts aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into Heaven, he ſent the holy Spirit
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:44321:172"/>upon his Apoſtles, and immediatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired them with a clear knowledge and underſtanding of it</hi> (And again page 24.) <hi>Although the firſt promulgator of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel were enabled by immediate Revelation from Chriſt to teach it unto others; yet afterward Gods ordinary way and method of tranſmitting the knowledge and faith of the Goſpel downwards to others ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively, was by ſuch mens teaching it to others, as had themſelves learned it of the Apoſtles, or others that taught the ſame Doctrine as they did.</hi> (Again page 28.) <hi>And there is great reaſon why the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard ſhould be given to what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Evangeliſts wrote, as to what they ſpoke; as long as they either wrote the ſame Doctrine, or History upon the ſame evidence; for the Doctrine is the ſame after it is written as it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for its being written doth not alter the nature of it: And therefore men muſt needs be as much concerned in their belief, or disbelief, obedience or diſobedience to it, when it is communicated to them by writing, as when it is ſo by preaching; (yea I had almost ſaid, or by immediate
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:44321:173"/>Revelation.)</hi> (And again page 33.) <hi>I ſhall conclude what I have ſaid in this propoſition, to ſhew that the ſame regard is due to the Doctrine of the Apostles, when written, (as now it is) as when it was preached by them, by remembring you of this great Truth, that every man ſhall be tryed or judged at the laſt day, by the Law he hath been under. The Gentiles that are or have been without a written Law, ſhall be judged without any ſuch Law, and the Jews which are under a written Law, they ſhall be judged by it,</hi> Rom. 2.12. <hi>Even ſo thoſe that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel written will be judged by that,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thus then I take the ſubſtance of his method to be, that the Apoſtles were immediatly Inſpired and from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Revelation; the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was written, and ſince that imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Revelation and Inſpiration of the Spirit hath ceaſed; and thoſe writings now are become the rule of faith and practice: And that this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel written, as he calls it, hath been ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively tranſmitted to others as they
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:44321:173"/>have learnt it; and that this written Goſpel (as he calls it) muſt be the rule and judge in all matters of faith and practice, without immediate Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Inſpiration.</p>
               <p>This then being the method of the Author of that Book, to exclude im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Revelation, and ſet up Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the room.</p>
               <p>But this he hath manifeſted by his writing, that he is not in the line of ſucceſſion in the holy Spirit of Truth and righteouſneſs; if he had been there, he would never have oppoſed the Truth of what was ſpoken by <hi>William Pen</hi> and <hi>Edward Burroughs:</hi> But who can expect any better fruit from a Plant that hath ſo little ſap and life from the root, and ſpring of Light, Truth and Holineſs to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh it.</p>
               <p>Page 41. (he ſaith,) <hi>That Chriſt doth inlighten all whom he doth inlighten in one or more of theſe three wayes.</hi> 1. <hi>Either by Natural Light. Or</hi> 2. <hi>by Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Revelation. Or</hi> 3. <hi>by outward ſpeech, or writing, or example,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:44321:174"/>Would not all that are in their wits judge that this Author of the Book had better to have been quiet then ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly in his high flown, proud, arrogant Spirit: So poſitively to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the ſufficiency of the Lights lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within into Chriſtianity; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out outward Teaching: Since he is at ſuch a loſs, not knowing what Light it is that Chriſt doth inlighten people with. But in page 43. there he ſaith, <hi>That though Chriſt do inlighten all men with natural light;</hi> a little before it is, <hi>them whom he doth inlighten;</hi> it is ſome way, even what he imagines, wherein he contradicts himſelf; but what way he knows not: The Vulture's eye hath not ſeen the way thereof, neither can the natural man receive the things of the Spirit of God: To be ſure the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of that Book hath not attained to <hi>A.B.C.</hi> in the way of Chriſtianity, as is manifeſt by his dark concluſion, <hi>that Chriſt the Light within men, is a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Light.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let all the wiſe in heart judge how unlikely the Author of that Book is
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:44321:174"/>to ſhew the way of God, who is ſo far out of it; not knowing the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goings of the Lord God who is Light, whoſe outgoings were from everlaſting to everlaſting, nor ſo much as the firſt principle of the Oracle of God, which is Light; and therefore he hath not ſpoken as the Oracle of God: And therefore in ſaying he would ſhew the method and way of God, he hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly declared his Ignorance and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption: But ſuch unlearned men as he is undertake to judge the <hi>Quakers</hi> foundation for error; and after they have done, they are to ſeek what it is: But let him or any who are of his mind prove if they can, that ever any <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> in their Writings have ſaid, <hi>That it was by the leading of a natural Light without, or with outward Teaching, by which ever any one true Chriſtian was made.</hi> No, no, we do know that Chriſt the true Light that Lighteneth man that comes into the World, doth it with a ſupernatural and Divine Light (wherein they that believe and wait upon God, receive Spirit, Life and
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:44321:175"/>Power to become Sons of God.) And that he both hath and can by the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful drawings thereof, bring them (who wait in the manifeſtation thereof in themſelves) into the true Chriſtianity: And that the outward Teſtimony or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration that was, or is given forth unto the Sons and Daughters of men from the immediate motion and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings forth of the Spirit of Truth; had and hath this effect, even to bring into this name, the Light of Chriſt within, and from Satans power unto God, that the teaching of God within, as well as without, by them who ſpeak as his Oracle, might be effectual to guide into Chriſtianity: And that the powerful drawings of the bleſſed Light of Chriſt within, hath been the only motive to move many to conſider their ways and to turn at the reproofs thereof into the ſtraight and narrow way that leads in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the life of Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>But I do ask a queſtion concerning the Gentiles, that both were and are without an outward written Law, ſince they muſt be judged without any
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:44321:175"/>ſuch Law; for tranſgreſſing of what Law muſt they be judged? it cannot be denyed but that God hath given them a Law to walk by, and that it is for the tranſgreſſion thereof that they come under condemnation, and muſt be judged. Before this queſtion be anſwered in Truth, that Goſpel muſt be known that is preached in every creature which is under Heaven.</p>
               <p>Page 37. The Author ſaith, <hi>we that have the Doctrine of Christ and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles brought down to us in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, may according to Scripture Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, be ſaid to have Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles; as truly as it was ſaid of the Jews in our Saviours days on Earth, that they had</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets; for it was by having in the Scriptures what they ſaid and did, that they were ſaid to have them; and by hearing and believing the Scriptures of the New Teſtament, we may as well be ſaid to hear and believe Chriſt and his Apoſtles,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> That ever ſuch a ſtranger to Chriſtianity ſhould be ſo impudent as to ſay, <hi>I will ſhew you the method and
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:44321:176"/>way of God,</hi> that doth not know him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf one ſtep therein, as appears by his dark arguing. The Jews had the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, and no queſtion but they did believe them to be ſo; but what did they profit by them? when out of that Faith and Spirit through which they are profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, they did teſtifie of Chriſt, and were a witneſs to the righteouſneſs of God, as ſaith the Apoſtle; when by them they judged Chriſt ought to die, Chriſt did ſend the hard-hearted Jews who went about to kill him, to <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets; ſaying, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.39, 40. <hi>Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal Life, and they are they which teſtifie of me; and ye will not come to me that ye may have life:</hi> And mind what the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.12. <hi>But now the righteouſneſs of God without the Law is manifeſted, being witneſſed by the Law and the Prophets;</hi> which righteouſneſs the ſaid Jews did not know, though they had heard what <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets ſaid of it: But mind the cauſe of their not hearing ſo
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:44321:176"/>as to underſtand, <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.20. <hi>Thougaveſt alſo thy good Spirit to instruct them,</hi> but the cauſe of their blindneſs was even their rebellion againſt Gods Spirit: And <hi>Stephen</hi> ſaid to the Jews <hi>Acts</hi> 7.51: <hi>Ye ſtiff-necked and uncircumciſed in heart and ears, ye do always reſist the Holy Ghost; as your Fathers did, ſo do ye:</hi> So it's very clear, though the Jews had <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets writings, yet by not taking heed to the Inſtruction of Gods Spirit in them, they were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the knowledge of them; and thus it is with the generality of thoſe called Chriſtians, they have ſome of the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things which gives a relation of Gods great love to the World in his heavenly and powerful gift of his holy Spirit ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in the fleſh to bruiſe the Serpents head, and to deſtroy the Devils works: But by diſeſteeming the bleſſed ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the Light of the Spirit of Chriſt in man, as the Author of that Book doth in calling it <hi>a natural Light;</hi> being thus in unblief, their fooliſh hearts are darkned: So though they have the New Teſtament, as it is called
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:44321:177"/>by many that do not know the Law and the Teſtimony, though they have ſome part of what was writ concerning Chriſt the Way, Truth and Life of Chriſtianity: Yet by their quenching and grieving the immediate motions of Gods holy Spirit in them, they are as clearly void of the knowledge of the end and tendency of Gods great love in and by the motion of his holy Spirit, that gave forth thoſe writings with the ſeveral bleſſed Teſtimonies therein, even as the hard-hearted Jews were of the Law and the Prophets when they were in the gainſaying and rebellion againſt Gods holy Spirit. But ſuch kind of ſmooth teaching, as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of that Book, who is unlearned in the bleſſed Teaching of the Spirit of Truth, is very pleaſant to unlearned people in the things of God; but the Scripture is fulfilled in many of them, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.41. <hi>Behold ye deſpiſers, and wonder and periſh, for I work a work in your days, a work which you ſhall in no wiſe believe, though a man declare it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="327" facs="tcp:44321:177"/>
               <p>So it's very clear, and that in a true ſenſe, that people may have the writings and not have Chriſt nor his Apoſtles, neither be in their Doctrine; but in lieu thereof they may have the Spirit of Antichriſt, and Doctrine of Antichriſt, and the ravening Woolves nature, though they may have the Sheeps clothing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> The Scriptures we muſt needs highly own, in that they refer us to (and exalt) Chriſt and his immediate teaching of his Divine Light and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit within, as being ſubſervient thereto, where they are received therein.</p>
               <p>But ſince a great part of the work of the Author of that Book is to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Scriptures, being a rule of Faith and Practice; and to gainſay the ſufficiency of the Spirits teaching with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Scriptures, or its immediate teaching now adays, without ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward teaching.</p>
               <p>I do ask whether the Authority be in the Spirit that ſpoke the words, or in the words when ſpoken or written? if none can deny but the Authority
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:44321:178"/>both was and is in the Spirit: And <hi>Iſaiah</hi> by the ſame Authority of Gods bleſſed Spirit, he can work a ſaving change in people, either with or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out what is written; therefore it is a high degree of preſumption in going about to limit the bleſſed holy Spirit of God, as the Author of that Book doth.</p>
               <p>But what Authority or effect had the true Prophets words in the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets mouths; this ſad effect, they ſtole away the hearts of people from the living fountain, and put them upon a vain labour in making broken Ciſterns that could hold no water.</p>
               <p>And what Authority, profit or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage have the true Miniſters and Apoſtles of Chriſts words now in the falſe Teachers mouths, with their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them: Even this ſad and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable effect; they thereby ſteal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the hearts of people from the ſenſe of the immediate motion of Gods holy Spirit in them, and to gainſay its power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful teachings; and the univerſal love of God in the moving of his univerſal
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:44321:178"/>holy Spirit through all the World, in its convincing and reproving the World of ſin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And then to ſet them upon vain and unprofitable ſervice: Firſt, having turned their hearts and minds out of the way that the holy Spirit of Truth leads in, and then ſet them upon a vain labour and travail in ſeeking, but never finding; till at length they conclude with the Devils Doctrine, that there is no way out of a body of ſin and death on this ſide the grave: And ſuch flattering and deceitful Teachers are in a high eſteem and account among a flattering deceitful people. So all may mind, that we do not oppoſe the in ward Teaching of the Spirit of Truth, to what outwardly hath been taught or written from the bleſſed motions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, or that may be taught or written by the motion of the ſame: But we do oppoſe the true Teachings thereof, to the falſe Teaching of all immaginary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful Spirits, who under a pretence of love to Souls, do make Merchandize of them.</p>
               <pb n="330" facs="tcp:44321:179"/>
               <p>And that being the great hinge on which his work depends, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding the Scriptures to be the rule of Faith and Practice, excluding the immediate Teaching of the Spirit, and the all-ſufficiency thereof. I do ask whether Faith be a fruit of the Spirit, or of the Scripture? or whether a true Chriſtians practice in living peaceably, lovingly, juſtly, and holy, and merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and in a clean life and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in long ſufference, patience, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, brotherly kindneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be a fruit of the bleſſed Spirit of God, or of the Scripture? And ſince it cannot be denyed, but that Faith and practice in a true Chriſtian holy Converſation, is a fruit of the bleſſed Spirit, and that the Scriptures ſay the ſame.</p>
               <p>Then are not all the gain-ſayers of the immediate Teaching, Opperation, Revelation and Divine Inſpiration of Gods holy Spirit of Truth, a grand cauſe that there is ſo little fruit of the Spirit brought forth in Chriſtendom? And whether that be not the cauſe of ſo many heaps of Sects, Notioniſts and

               <p>But in Page 42. the Author ſaith, <hi>Chriſt indeed or God Creator, as he is deſcribed in the beginning of that Chap.</hi> Joh. 1.9. Doth enlighten every one that cometh into the World, <hi>with the faculty of reaſon and underſtanding, by which he may know that there is a God, and that he is to be worſhipped, and that he is peaceable, and the difference between moral good and evil, in many things: But however this may poſſibly be a light ſufficient to direct the Heathen to as much as God expects from them, (if they live up to it) to whom he affords no other Light, yet this Natural Light is not ſufficient to direct thoſe that live under the Goſpel, to believe, and do what they are bound to believe, and do upon pain of Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <pb n="332" facs="tcp:44321:180"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer,</hi> He hath clearly manifeſted his ignorance of the Goſpel, and what men are to be brought under that are made true Chriſtians, as if the Light of Chriſt within had not Goſpel in it, or could not miniſter Goſpel: But by hating of the Light; how blind are they, who have ſuch low thoughts of thy way thereof? accounting the Light of Chriſt natural, yet ſufficient to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the Heathen as much as God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects of them.</p>
               <p>Such is the eſteem of them whom the God of this world hath blinded their minds, taking the Jew outward for the Jew inward, and the Chriſtian in ſhew, for the Chriſtian in Truth: And the wild Heatheniſh life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation of the Chriſtian in ſhew, for Chriſtianity, if they do but only in words own the Scriptures to be their rule of faith and practice. And the true Chriſtian that brings forth the fruits of Gods holy Spirit in life and converſation, and is not aſhamed to confeſs to the immediate motions of it in its bleſſed leadings and teaching to
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:44321:180"/>love of God above all, and their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours as themſelves; and lives in true fear and watchfulneſs, that they may not grieve nor quench the immediate motions of Gods holy Spirit in them; but are careful to live up to the reaſon and underſtanding that Chriſt hath illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated or inſpired them with, and to eſhew the evil and to love the good, being ſhewed it by the Light of Chriſt; and that God ought to be worſhiped in Spirit and Truth, and is in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance thereof according to Gods will, confeſſing to the bleſſed holy Spirit of God to be the rule of Life, Faith practice. Such a faithful and true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian as this, having ſuch an account to give, as is given by <hi>Edward Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi> and <hi>William Pen</hi> of the ſufficiency of the pure Spirit of God, to be the Judge of all matters of life and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.</p>
               <p>Such true Chriſtians are very ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteemed by ſuch private immaginary Spirits as the Author of that Book is manifeſt to be of in all his works of darkneſs in that Book. But I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:44321:181"/>be a Chriſtian, and though I am called Heathen; then to be a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and yet to be called and accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>In Page 61. the Author ſaith, <hi>Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place miſunderſtood and miſapplyed by you, is</hi> Joh. 16.13. When the Spirit of Truth is come, he will guide you into all Truth; <hi>which is not a promiſe of ſending the Spirit to guide all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians by its immediate motions: But a promiſe to his Apostles, for they only were then preſent with Christ at his paſſover,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſ.</hi> Indeed the immediate moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Gods holy Spirit, is the great trouble of them who follow the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their own Spirit, and lives out of the way of the knowledge of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit of God, which is Light and Life. But I ask, in caſe people are not to follow Chriſt and his Apoſtles into the true Faith and practice of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, by the immediate motions of Gods holy Spirit of Truth; by the motions of what Spirit are they to be led and guided? ſince there is ſuch va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:44321:181"/>of Sects and Opinions in the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their private Spirits, which of them is to be followed.</p>
               <p>But ſince the Author hath limited the immediate motions of Gods holy Spirit only unto the Apoſtles: I do ask into what Spirits motions were people Baptized, and led into the body of Chriſtianity? or are they now to be led into the ſame; and how can Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians have the Crown of Immortal Life as <hi>Paul</hi> had in finiſhing his courſe of life well, and he ſaid, <hi>that was not laid up for him alone, but alſo for all them that love the appearance of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Christ:</hi> And who can be a follower of him in the way, if they do not take heed to the immediate motions of Gods holy Spirit, as he did according to the meaſure and manifeſtation thereof in every one? And again,</p>
               <p>What can ſet people free from the ſpirit of bondage, or from the ſpirit of error or corruption, and deceit, and hypocriſie; but the immediate moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Gods pure holy ſpirit in them?</p>
               <pb n="336" facs="tcp:44321:182"/>
               <p>But ſuch is the dark work of the Author of that Book, even to gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay, and limit the immediate motions of Gods holy Spirit, and to ſet up the private ſelfiſh imaginary Spirit which is not in unity with the Light and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Truth.</p>
               <p>But if the promiſe of Chriſt was only to give that gift of the immediate mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods holy Spirit unto the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; then to what end did he counſel the Churches to Pray in the Spirit, to Sing in the Spirit, and to perſevere and go on in the Spirit, and not to quench and grieve the Spirit, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance more to this purpoſe in Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to the Churches to follow the ſpirit, and mortifie the deeds of the fleſh by the ſpirit: Had not Chriſtians need to have the immediate motions and help of Gods bleſſed ſpirit in this work, and to be their rule of life and guide in judgment, that all wicked malitious ſpirits under the cover of the Prophets, Chriſts and the Apoſtles words, may be judged down, let all the wiſe in heart conſider this and lay it to heart.</p>
               <pb n="337" facs="tcp:44321:182"/>
               <p>What a ſad tendency ſuch unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table talkers and teaching hath, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the immediate motion, and teaching, and guiding of Gods holy ſpirit; and whether ſuch Agents and props in the Divels kingdom and power of darkneſs, be not a lett to the bleſſed works of the Lord? who ſits upon his Throne, and ſaith, <hi>behold I make all things new.</hi> And whether ſuch dark works as are manifeſt in that Book, be not the cauſe that there are ſo many mockers now adays at the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate motions of Gods holy ſpirit, in and through his ſervants, according to their ſeveral meaſures and ſervices therein? But ſuch is the work of all dark ſpirits, to pretend love to peoples ſouls: But in the dark to work againſt the great love and mercy of God in the immediate motions of his holy and bleſſed ſpirit, for the bringing of ſouls to peace and happineſs, and everlaſting reſt in his heavenly gift, the which is life Eternal.</p>
               <p>But by what hath been written, as before, the whole drift, ſcope and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:44321:183"/>of the Authors ſpirit in that Book may be ſeen, where ſeveral par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars might be anſwered with the ſame ſharp reproof, as that which is anſwered hath: Such works have been anſwered over and over again, as may be ſeen at large in abundance of Books; but one more eſpecially I refer the Reader to: And that is a Book Intitled, <hi>The Chriſtian</hi> Quaker and <hi>his Divine Teſtimony vindicated,</hi> &amp;c. By <hi>George Whitehead</hi> and <hi>William Pen:</hi> And though the Author of that Book hath concealed his Name, and covered his ſpirit of Error with ſmooth words ſtolen out of the Scriptures, yet by the light of Chriſt Jeſus he is ſeen clearly, though he calls that Light Natural, and like a fooliſh builder hath built without the Corner-ſtone: By the Light of Chriſt his building is ſeen to be raiſed from no other foundation and ground, but meer imaginations: And that it muſt be caſt down into the pit of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs out of which it was raiſed.</p>
               <p>So though he may complain, as he doth in the beginning of his Book,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:44321:183"/>of the entertainment others have had in the like endeavours: Yet unto the Truth and wiſdom of God in all who have not loſt the ſenſe of his holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit from them, I do appeal whether this be not an entertainment according to Truth.</p>
               <p>And though he hath pretended his work to be in love to ſouls; yet it is manifeſt in the Light of Chriſt, to have this tendency; even to deprive ſouls of the infinite benefit of the ſenſe and injoyment of the immediate motions of Gods holy ſpirit, and to make void their Teſtimonies who are planted into the ſame: But to prevent the Enemies works, is this written in love to Truth and Righteouſneſs, and all people who deſire after the ſame.</p>

<pb n="352" facs="tcp:44321:190"/>and ſo to confeſs and acknowledge ſin, and ſo to repent and forſake ſin, and this is the way to obtain mercy and forgiveneſs of ſin. And by its leading and guiding to abſtain from the appearance of evil, unto this Spirit of Truth you muſt bow, and take it for your leader, if ever you come truly to call God Father, and he owns you to be his Sons.</p>
            <p>In your Confeſſion you ſay, <hi>Almighty and moſt merciful Father, we have erred and ſtrayed from thy wayes like loſt ſheep; we have followed too wuch the devices and deſires of our own hearts, we have offended againſt thy holy Laws, we have left undone thoſe things which we ought to have done, and there is no health in us,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> And when do you intend to do otherwiſe, ſince you have appointed this form of words to be always ſaid. Oh turn for ſhame unto the true Spepherd and Biſhop of your Soul; and don't come ſtill with this ſad un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable ſtory before the Lord. (Mind) if a man offend againſt the Laws of the Nation, if it be but once he is lyable to the puniſhment that is preſcribed by that Law, or if a Servant ſhould but once do the thing he ſhould not do, and leave undone the things he ſhould do, this would incurr his Maſters diſpleaſure; but if he ſhould continue doing ſo, he would turn him out of his ſervice and account of him as he is an unprofitable Servant: How then can you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be heard and received of the Lord, who
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:44321:190"/>are alwayes doing that you ſhould not do, and leaving undone that you ſhould do; you may well ſay you have no health in you, neither are you like to have, ſo long as you continue in theſe ſad practices: And in that you do offend Gods righteous Law, how can you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect but to be puniſhed by the righteous Judge? Indeed you have done that which you ought not to have done, in that you have cauſed to ſuffer ſo many innocent people, both by long Impriſonment, and ſpoiling of their Goods; in that you have ſhewn no more mercy to them, how can you expect to receive mercy at the hand of God, ſeeing thoſe ſufferers have been a people fearing God, and hoping for his mercy in whom the Lord takes pleaſure, and in his pleaſure he hath ſuſtained them, wherein many have been faithful and true witneſſes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of many have departed this World under their ſeveral confinements in peace; and many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains living to this day confeſſing and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying to the mercies and favour of God in the manifeſtation of the Law of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus, which ſets free them who walk up to it from the Law of ſin and death: And that there is great peace in keeping this holy Law, this hath been, and is the Teſtimony of them who are, and have been led by the Spirit of Truth, witneſſing unto the Way, Truth and Life, the way of peace and happineſs: And thus in the good will of God in good
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:44321:191"/>will to all mankind, in patient ſuffering under your wills who have followed too much the devices and deſires of your own hearts, and thereby having rejected the councel of the Spirit of Truth, you have provoked the Lord, as you ſay in theſe words: <hi>We have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked thine anger, thy wrath is waxed hot, and thy heavy diſpleaſure is ſore kindled againſt us.</hi> You have confeſſed to the Truth, and when you come to feel the weight of your many tranſgreſſions againſt Gods holy Law, then you will wiſh you had been ſerious in what you have ſaid, and that you had broken off your ſins by a true and unfeigned repentance: And for this end hath Gods holy Spirit ſtrove with you many wayes; but ſee by your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion how evilly you have required this love.</p>
            <p>Your words are, <hi>We ſinful people of this land do acknowledge before thee, to thy glory and our own ſhame and confuſion, that never any Nation under Heaven had more experience of all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of thy goodneſs, and the methods of our amendment; nor yet did ever any more ſhamful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abuſe them, when thou gaveſt us great and long proſperities, we ſed our ſelves to the full, waxed fat and wanton, and kicked againſt thee; when thou threweſt us into horrid confuſions, from which we ſaw then little hope of ariſing, even in the time of that diſtreſs did we treſpaſs yet more againſt thee, when by miracles of mercy thou hadſt turned our captivities, we ſoon returned
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:44321:191"/>to folly, to our vomit, and to our wallowing in our former or greater filthineſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> This is a very ſad miſerable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion indeed, much to be lamented; you had need conſider it and be in Truth humbled for it; and to forſake that evil Spirit that hath been your leader in thoſe horrid practices, and to wait upon the Lord for the leading and guiding of you out of thoſe evils, that you may have a better account to give unto the Lord in the day of account, as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had when the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was ſent unto him with this Meſſage from the Lord: Saying, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, ſet thine houſe in order for thou ſhalt die and not live; then</hi> Hezekiah <hi>tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his face toward the wall and prayed unto the Lord; and ſaid, remember now O Lord I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee, how I have walked before in Truth, and with a perfect heart; and have done that which is good in thy ſight, and</hi> Hezekiah <hi>wept ſore.</hi> And the Lord heard his prayers, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his tears, he was very gratious and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful unto him, as you may read: Now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare his confeſſion with your confeſſion; and ſeeing you have no better account to give, you may well be aſhamed and confounded at the thoughts of what acceptance you can think to have, and reward at the hand of the Lord.</p>

And in that Faſt that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable unto him, that thee mighteſt have been found in turning from the evil of thy do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and in anſwering the Lords juſt requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, in doing juſtly, and walking humbly, and ſhewing mercy in remembring the meek, and them who fear the Lord, in whom the Lord takes pleaſure, and in renting of your falſe coverings, and have put off your loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fome clothing, the which you confeſs you are under, and to have rent your hearts in deed and in truth, and to have abſtained from the appearance of Evil, and to have let the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed go free: Had you choſen this Faſt, and truly turned to the Lord, and in ſimplicity to have waited upon him, to have known his mind and pleaſure in his ſore and grievous and never to be forgotten Judgments, with which he did viſit you, by Sword, by Plague, and by Fire: (Oh how can you eaſily paſs over the remembrance thereof.) If I ſay you had conſidered your ways, and by abſtaining from the appearances of evil, you had truly turned unto the Lord; you might then have expected to have found favour of him, and in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and wiſdom you might have been directed to have been eſtabliſht in the fear of the Lord, and in his righteous way to have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed;
